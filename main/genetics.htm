    My latest in a long line of unexplained sudden interests is genetics.
    &nbsp;I knew that these is some kind of big revolution going on and it was
    about genetics, but until recently I knew absolutely nothing about the
    subject and so had very little idea what this was all about.<br>
    <br>
    Well actually I can explain what triggered this sudden interest: It happened
    when I found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PL848F2368C90DDC3D"
      target="_blank">THESE</a> lectures on Youtube by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky"
      target="_blank">Robert Sapolsky</a>, within minutes I was hooked.
    &nbsp;What I was learning was just staggering, if you have not seen these
    lectures then you must<small>. &nbsp;T<big>here are many hours of lectures
        but every minute is just full of fascinating / life changing information
        and Professor Sapolsky delivers them beautifully <small>(btw-these
          lectures cover a lot of subjects other than just genetics)</small><br>
          <br>
        </small></big></small><small><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also recommend
        the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_%28book%29" target="_blank">Genome
          by Matt Ridley</a> -<small> it is not a technical book, it tells some
          of the most amazing stories from the world of genetics -&nbsp;a very
          easy read.</small></big></small><br>
    <small><big><br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><small><big><span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Stuff I find interesting:</span><br>
        <br>
        It is now possible that a whole genome can be sequenced in a week.
        &nbsp;In 2003 when the first human genome had finally been sequenced it
        had taken 13 years,</big></small><small><big> a worldwide effort taking
        many billions of pounds&nbsp;</big></small><small> this demonstrates just how
        quickly genetic technology is coming on, we are clearly at the beginning
        of a world changing revolution and this is something we all need to have
        a basic understanding of.&nbsp; I would imagine that in a few years it
        will become standard practice for everyone to have their genome
        sequenced....<br>
        <br>
      </big></small>Human DNA consists of 23 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"
      target="_blank">chromosomes</a> which contain around 3.2 billion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pairs"
      target="_blank">base pairs</a>, this equates to about the amount of data
    which can be stored on a CD Rom <small>(786mb - more info <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome"
        target="_blank">HERE</a>)</small>, each cell in your body contains two
    sets of these <small>(one from each parent)</small> this equates to around
    1.5 gigabytes in total. &nbsp;The DNA is a very small part of a cell, a
    single cell can not be seen with the naked eye, so when you are next amazed
    by how small the memory card in your phone is, it is worth remembering that
    to store 16gb of information would only require the dna from 10 of your
    cells -&nbsp;we have a long way to go yet before we catch up with
    nature.....<br>
    BTW - It is interesting how dna is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"
      target="_blank">digital</a> and so can be compared to computer technology
    in this way. &nbsp;As a computer person learning about genetics it is
    apparent how similar the two fields can seem............it can sometimes be
    more like learning about an advanced computer than biology !<br>
    <br>
    If you take all the DNA in a single human cell and stretch it out, it would
    be 2 meters long. &nbsp;If you did this with all the cells in your body the
    total length would be 113 billion miles !<br>
    <br>

    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><small><big><br>
      </big></small><small><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">My Story</span><br>
        <br>
        After watching many lectures and reading several books on genetics I
        decided the best way to learn more about all of this would be to look at
        what information can be found in my own DNA, so I started looking into
        if there is any way I could get my genome sequenced. <br>
        As I suspected it is far more expensive than I am prepared to pay -
        although it seems you can now get the main parts of your genome
        sequenced for around $1000 (<small>see Manuel Corpas's blog</small>&nbsp;
        <small>- link below)</small>&nbsp; I don't think this is really an
        option for myself yet.<br>
        <br>
        There are however companies who will test a lot of standard variations
        in your genome ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"
          target="_blank">SNPs</a> - pronounced snips )&nbsp; for around £180 <small>(including
a
          years subscription and postage both ways) </small>This is more like
        the sort of price I can afford, so without delay I sent off for the kit
        from <a href="http://www.23andme.com" target="_blank">23ANDME</a> - so
        watch this space for the continuing story on what develops from this
        adventure !<br>
        <small>See a great presentation on what 23andme is all about <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=23andme&amp;source=video&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDwQtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQ6KUf75bBEQ&amp;ei=uhOtTqqGEsPs8QOZsfyAAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHVM_whwkMSKgFWVH9Sk0Erc5GjA&amp;sig2=5YyKWTDIYA8AaE7gNjpElw"
            target="_blank">HERE</a></small><br>
        <small>Note: before doing this yourself it is worth taking some time to
          consider if you really want to know the sort of information which may
          come from this sort of test.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><big>23andme provide
            a lot of information on-line when you have the results, keeping you
            up to date with the latest information, providing forums, lots of
            ways to add to your info to help with the scientific research they
            do etc.&nbsp;so it should be a very interesting and worthwhile
            exercise. &nbsp;You can also download the raw data and load this
            into other applications and explore the results this way.<br>
            <small><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JE-djHSyLc&amp;feature=youtu.be"
                target="_blank">HERE</a> is a short video showing how worthwhile
              this service (personal genomics) can be to an individual.</small><br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">26-10-11</span>&nbsp;The kit is
            coming from California so I expected it to take a long time to get
            to me, but 4 days later it arrived - my sample has now been sent off
            to California <br>
            I Had a look at </big></small></big></small><a href="http://www.snpedia.com/"
      target="_blank">SNPedia</a> last night, looks like this site will be very
    interesting as I will be able to feed my raw data into this and pull out
    lots of info.<small><big><small><big><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">28-10-11</span> Received an email
            to say my sample has arrived at 23andme - pretty quick! &nbsp;It
            will now take 4-6 weeks for my results to be ready.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">18-11-11</span> My results have
            arrived! &nbsp; &nbsp; just starting to get to grips with what they
            mean now<br>
            <br>
            The first thing I have noticed is I carry a mutated gene which
            results in a reduction of levels of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-1_antitrypsin_deficiency"
              target="_blank">Alpha-1 antitrypsin</a> <small>(no, I had never
              heard of it either)</small> which is a protein giving protection
            to the lungs and liver from damage.<br>
            I am heterozygous<small> (i.e.&nbsp; the two copies of this gene I
              have are different)</small> so I have one normal and one mutated
            copy, the mutated version I have&nbsp;still functions but only
            produces 60-70% of the levels it should.<br>
            As this gene is codominant (i.e. each copy of the gene should
            produce 50% of my alpha-1 antitrypsin requirement) by my calculation
            this means I only have 80% the levels of this protein which I
            should. &nbsp;I don't think this is low enough to worry about but it
            may be worth mentioning to my doctor next time I visit as it can
            lead to emphysema. More info <a href="http://www.alpha-1foundation.org/"

          </big></small></big></small><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      20-02-13</span> I received an email from Ian Logan to let me know he has
    kindly run my results through his program which "looks at 23andMe results
    and finds the 40-100 most rare/uncommon results out of the 900,000+ tested"
    - this can be seen <a href="http://www.ianlogan.co.uk/23andme/open/alanesq.htm"
      target="_blank">HERE</a><br>
    He informs me that: <br>
    <pre wrap=""><big>	Your results shows your European background well.<br>	You do not have any homozygous-recessive results; and no suggestion of consanguinity in the pedigree.<br>	I note that your results do not show any other SNPs of particular note (as far as I know at present).<br>	Although some of them are unusual and interesting nevertheless.</big></pre>
    I now need to spend some time now figuring out what it all means.<br>
