      <h2>Progress of my attempt to build a Schickard Calculator:</h2>
      
      As with most of my projects, rather than study or plan first what I intend to do I just jump in and make a start, so this is not going to <br>
      be historically correct etc. but will be loosly based on the information kindly provided by http://www.jepu.info/schickard/english.html <br>
      and adapted to be easy/cheap for me to build using materials easily available and using my home made CNC router.

      Not much progress recently as I have been waiting for parts and working on other projects but the parts have now arrived...

      I am currently working on building the adder unit.  The main time taken so far has been devising a system to cause the wheels to click between number<br>
      selected and to get the carry system to work.  The issue with the carry is there is a conflict between the requirement for the arm (extended gear tooth)<br>
      to be long enough to turn the adjacent gear enough to click over to the next number and for it to be short enough not to prevent the adjacent gear<br>
      from being turned manually.  I now have it working very reliably for a single carry but if the carry is to progress to the next gear it requires <br>
      assistance.  I see from the videos in the link above that he also has to do this and I think this is just a problem with this design where all the<br>
      carries try to occur simultaneously rather than ripple through as more modern machines do.  It may be that if the gears were made from metal this <br>
      would be improved as there would be less give/flex in the system? <br>
      I am now happy with my design so have moved from prototyping to making a start at building the complete adder unit and a sub frame to fit it in to<br>
