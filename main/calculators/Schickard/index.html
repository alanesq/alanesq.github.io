        As with most of my projects, it was a sudden and ill thought through decision to do it and rather than study or 
        plan first what I intend to do I just jump in and make a start, so this is not historically correct etc. but is 
        loosly based on information kindly provided by Jens Puhle 
        <a href="http://www.jepu.info/schickard/english.html" target="_blank">HERE</a> 
        and adapted to be easy/cheap for me to build using materials easily available (mostly MDF) and using my home made 
        CNC router. 
        <br><br>
        
        I first learned of the existence of the Schickard Calculator on 10th November and on 29th I had finished building my 
        own which has to be some kind of record? ;-)

          I found the imprtant thing was to get the shape of the indexing arms correct, once I had done this the carry 
          works surprisingly well although if it is carrying across several wheels it can require some assistance which 
          I believe is normal for these machines judging from other videos I have seen.  This actually works well though 
          as you can easily see which wheels have not fully turned and simply give them a tweak to help them to the next 
          digit.<br>
          If you request by email I can send you the drawings I used to create it on my CNC, they are just simple Inkscape 
          files which I then used JScut to produce the gcode.  I used brass welding rods for axles and the inspiration I 
          was most pleased with was to use the inserts from electrical block connectors to attach the gear wheels to the 
          axle.
