      <h2>Progress of my attempt to build a Schickard Calculator:</h2>
      
      I am not attempting to create a historically correct replica, it is inspired by the info given by:  http://www.jepu.info/schickard/english.html <br>
      and is adapted to a design I can reasnably quickly create using my cnc router using cheap, easily available parts.<br><br>

    <div style="text-align: left;">  
      I am currently working on building the adder unit.  The main time taken so far has been devising a system to cause the wheels to click between number<br>
      selected and to get the carry system to work.  The issue with the carry is there is a conflict between the requirement for the arm (extended gear tooth)<br>
      to be long enough to turn the adjacent gear enough to click over to the next number and for it to be short enough not to prevent the adjacent gear<br>
      from being turned manually.  I now have it working very reliably for a single carry but if the carry is to progress to the next gear it requires <br>
      assistance.  I see from the videos in the link above that he also has to do this and I think this is just a problem with this design where all the<br>
      carries try to occur simultaneously rather than ripple through as more modern machines do.  It may be that if the gears were made from metal this <br>
      would be improved as there would be less give/flex in the system? <br>
