        As with most of my projects, it was a sudden and ill thought through decision to do it and rather than study or 
        plan first what I intend to do I just jump in and make a start, so this is not historically correct etc. but is 
        loosly based on information kindly provided by Jens Puhle 
        <a href="http://www.jepu.info/schickard/english.html" target="_blank">HERE</a> 
        and adapted to be easy/cheap for me to build using materials easily available (mostly MDF) and using my home made 
        CNC router. 
        <br><br>
        
        I first learned of the existence of the Schickard Calculator on 10th November and on 29th I had finished building my 
        own which has to be some kind of record? ;-)

        Discovering the correct shape for the indexing arms was crucial for the carry mechanism to function effectively. 
        Although, when carrying across multiple wheels, some manual intervention may be required. 
        I believe this is a common occurrence in these types of machines, as observed in other videos. This is not a 
        problem though as it is easy to identify which wheels need a nudge to reach the next digit.<br>
        If you're interested, I can send you the drawings used to create this mechanism on my CNC machine via email. 
        These are just simple Inkscape files, which were then converted to Gcode using JScut. I used brass coated welding 
        rods for the axles, and I was very pleased with my idea to utilize electrical block connector inserts to attach 
        the gear wheels to the axles. <br>
        I was very pleased with the way the adder unit worked out, there are several things I could improve to the rest 
        of it, mainly due to my having no plan as I built it, just working it out as I went along.  The windows to the 
        Napiers Bones are too small for starters...<br><br>
