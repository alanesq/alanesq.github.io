                  thoughts:<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br>
                  When I first signed up for the challenge I thought that
                  actually this
                  will not be that much difference to my normal lifestyle as I
                  live on a
                  pretty low income already, but as the date gets closer I&nbsp;
                  start to
                  realise it is going to be a much bigger challenge
                  than I first thought.&nbsp; Creating a meal for £1 would be no
                  real
                  problem at all, but living 24hrs on £1 is another matter!!!<br>
                  The 5 days I expect not to be too bad, but if I reach the £250
                  target
                  and thus carry on for the 10 days then this will be a much
                  greater
                  challenge...<br>
                  I deliberately have made no real plan as I figure that it will
                  be more
                  "real" if I just jump in at the deep end.&nbsp; It is
                  recommended that
                  you buy the
                  weeks food all in one go but I think it will be more
                  interesting to
                  start each day with a £1 coin and take it from there.&nbsp;
                  Tesco have
                  been known to sell tins of mushy peas for as low as 3p a tin,
                  but they
                  are 15p at the moment and I doubt I will by lucky enough for
                  them to
                  drop in the near future.&nbsp; I know a local shop which if
                  you time it
                  right you can buy bread very cheaply as it is going out of
                  date.&nbsp; </td>

                <td style="vertical-align: top;">I have been cruising the
                  supermarkets a lot recently on the lookout for
                  a bargain.&nbsp; I
                  have found a few promising items and I will do a shop on
                  Sunday to get
                  some bits in ready for the start of the challenge on Monday.<br>
                  I usually drink vast amounts of coffee but this will have to
                  stop as
                  the cheapest coffee I have found is 47p for a small jar <small>(this
                    I
                    don't think would last me long and I know it would be really
                    bad
                    tasting)</small> but I have found at Asda 80 tea bags for
                  27p - so I
                  guess I am drinking tea next week.<br>
                  Tesco sell a packet of rich tea biscuits for 24p so I will
                  probably get
                  a pack of these in and split it between the 5 days.&nbsp; I
                  have been
                  pleased to find 1kg of rice at Tesco for 40p, this will I
                  suspect prove
                  to be my main food source.&nbsp; Lots of the cheaper foods
                  I find are not suitable for vegans, so this is adding to the
                  challenge,
                  it is rather disappointing<small> (and surprising) </small>that
                  it
                  appears cheap eggs
                  and meat are available but no cheap fruit and veg.&nbsp; My
                  being
                  vegan may in one respect be a help though, in that I am
                  already used to
                  the idea of being surrounded by food and other people eating
                  but not
                  able to eat any of it myself.<br>
                  Alcohol will be out of the question so this will be a bit of a
                  nightmare in its self, especially if it goes on for more than
                  the 5
                  days.<br>
                  I have not found any kind of cheap fruit/veg yet.&nbsp; I was
                  planning
                  to
                  search markets etc. but from reading up on others who have
                  taken the
                  challenge it sounds like fruit and veg is a luxury I will have
                  to do
                  without<small> (luckily I don't like healthy food anyway ;-)</small><br>
                  -
                  All in all, it looks like being a pretty miserable week with
                  no
                  alcohol, feeling hungry much of the time and on top of this it
                  being my
                  first week back after my holiday.&nbsp; The logistics of how
                  to deal
                  with my weekly meeting with friends at a local cafe and the
                  evening
                  meals with Linda have yet to be figured out??? <br>
                  - I have just realised; I get 5% discount at Sainsburys, I had
                  forgotten about that - so I can get 1kg of rice from
                  Sainsburys for
                  38p.&nbsp; It is a strange experience even for me to be so
                  excited at a
                  2p saving ;-)<br>

                  So I now have some basics in and I have around 60p a day to
                  play with. <br>
                  I
                  figure the bread and jam plus some biscuits should get me
                  through to
                  evening when I can cook some kind of main meal.&nbsp; Don't
                  expect

                  After
                  reading about a few other people who have taken this challenge
                  I
                  realise I will be taking a very different approach to
                  most.&nbsp;
                  Rather than the more usual seeing what creative meals I can
                  russle up
                  on a very low budget I will be tending more towards maximum
                  quantity
                  for least effort ;-)<br>
                  <br>
                  The first morning of the challenge and the true horror of what
                  I have
                  got myself into starts to dawn.&nbsp; I am about to try my
                  first cup of
                  extremely cheap tea with 6 rich tea biscuits for breakfast (I
                  know this
                  is not a great start but I often skip breakfast anyway).&nbsp;
                  Lunch
                  will be three slices of bread and jam.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
                    4:30pm</span><br>
                  Today was ok, I had 3 slices of bread and jam at lunch and 2
                  more when
                  I got home <br>
                  I did a bit of research at lunch and found Asda sell a jar of
                  <a href="http://groceries.asda.com/asda-estore/search/searchcontainer.jsp?trailSize=1&amp;searchString=curry+sauce&amp;domainName=Products&amp;headerVersion=v1&amp;_requestid=691444"
                    target="_blank">curry
                    sauce for 18p</a> which as far as I can tell is vegan - this
                  is
                  excellent
                  news and I will give it a try tonight.<br>
                  <br>
                  This evening I am to cook a meal for myself and Linda, I was
                  going to
                  cook something else for Linda but she says she is game to try
                  what I am
                  having.&nbsp; The plan is to use the following:<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp; 200g of rice - bought Sunday (I will add 200g of
                  rice for
                  Linda's portion)<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 onions - bought Sunday (I will add an extra
                  onion for
                  Linda)<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 tin of Tesco Kidney Beans - 21p (thought I
                  would splash
                  out on a luxury)<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 jar of curry sauce - 18p<br>
                  I am sure I will eat it, but will be interesting to see what
                  Linda
                  makes of it.&nbsp; The&nbsp; remaining 22p of today's budget I
                  blew on
                  some biscuits from Asda (Ginger Nuts).<br>
                  <br>
                  The guys at work had the idea that I should aim to have £2
                  left at the
                  end of the week so I can have a pint with them Friday, but as
                  I only
                  have £2.37 left now I don't think this is going to happen.<br>
                  <br>
                  I am sure you are keen to know how the tea is going.&nbsp; As
                  I am sure
                  you expected, it is really bad !<br>
                  I have been drinking it all day but I can imagine that by
                  Friday I will
                  be at near breaking point.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">10pm</span><br>
                  As expected the meal wasn't great, but we ate it.&nbsp; The
                  rice is not
                  very good, think I will give pasta a try next time.&nbsp; The
                  sauce
                  wasn't too bad though really.&nbsp; Treating myself to a few
                  biscuits
                  before bed.........<br>

                  Biscuits again this morning - I really need to find something
                  a bit
                  better than this but they are so cheap and so good.&nbsp; A
                  big box of
                  Corn flakes can be bought for 31p which would be good, but
                  they are not
                  vegan.&nbsp; I plan to go to Sainsburys after work to have
                  another hunt
                  round for something cheap and a bit better than
                  biscuits.&nbsp; Bread
                  and jam again at lunch.&nbsp; <br>
                  Is it any wonder that people on low income in this country
                  have such a
                  poor diet, there really should be some cheap fruit/veg
                  available.&nbsp;
                  On a related subject, where is all this cheap booze I keep
                  hearing
                  about?????<br>
                  I was looking at <a href="http://firstperson.oxfamamerica.org/2013/01/23/7-photos-that-reveal-what-families-eat-in-one-week/"
                    target="_blank">THIS</a> interesting item on what people
                  around the

                  I must confess I have suffered a bit today - walking through
                  Nottingham
                  passing all the food places was hell......<br>
                  My total is now £202 - big thank you to everyone who has
                  sponsored
                  me.&nbsp; There are still several people at work who have
                  promised to
                  sponsor me, so hopes of it all being over by Saturday are fast
                  disappearing.<br>
                  My visit to Sainsburys to find something better were a
                  complete fail,
                  guess it is back to the biscuits - lol<br>
                  I am planning a late night raid on the local supermarkets in
                  the hope
                  of a bargain.&nbsp; Tonight I think Tesco veg soup (24p) with
                  added
                  onion and lots of bread is the
                  way to go.<br>

                  Bagged myself 3 small tin loaves for 25p each, these will be

                  Last nights meal was very good, there is much more in those
                  small
                  loaves than I thought so plenty of last nights loaf left for a
                  decent
                  amount of toast and jam at breakfast :-)<br>
                  It would be nice to have some oil for cooking onions, I will
                  see if I
                  can find anything cheap enough but I am not optimistic.&nbsp;
                  Some
                  margarine would be ideal as I could also use it on my bread
                  and jam.<br>
                  <br>
                  I have been emailing more people today asking for sponsors, I
                  must be
                  mad as there is still a chance I can end this Friday ;-)<br>
                  I had a terrible thought - I have stated that if I collect
                  well beyond
                  £500 I am "duty bound to carry on past 10 days", what if this
                  diary
                  goes viral - I could end up on this challenge for months
                  !!!!&nbsp; ;-)<br>
                  <br>
                  Three challenges face me today: <br>
                  &nbsp;1)&nbsp; I am eating with Linda again tonight so I
                  need to figure out what we will have <br>
                  &nbsp;2)&nbsp; I am meeting friends in Beeston for coffee so
                  what to do
                  about that? (I am hoping they will
                  not charge me for tap water).<br>
                  &nbsp;3)&nbsp; I am not at work so I have lots of spare time
                  to feel
                  hungry (the ginger biscuits are already lost...)<br>
                  <br>
                  I was going to try pasta today but as I have so much bread in
                  stock now
                  I
                  guess tonight's meal really needs to include this, so I will
                  probably
                  opt
                  for seeing if I can improve on last nights meal and convert it
                  into
                  something more like a stew, I think I will see if I can get
                  some cheap
                  frozen veg of some kind.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">5pm</span><br>
                  I
                  had a jam sandwich at lunch then went to meet with friends -
                  The owner
                  of he establishment was very good and provided tap water
                  f.o.c.<br>
                  so I will give a plug here for the best coffee in Beeston (if
                  not
                  Nottingham) - <a href="http://www.nottingham.co.uk/listing/123495-Local-Not-Global-Deli/"
                    target="_blank">Local Not Global</a><br>
                  <br>
                  I bought a bag of frozen mixed veg at 75p from Tesco, but
                  after looking
                  at the finances I have decided I just can't afford it, I would
                  end up
                  with plenty of veg but nothing to go with it - so it will have
                  to go in
                  my freezer for after the challenge :-(<br>
                  So instead I have bought a tin of veg soup for 24p, more
                  biscuits for
                  22p and a tin of potatoes for 14p<br>
                  <br>
                  Tonight's
                  meal will be pretty much the same as last nights - which
                  whilst not very inventive at least I know it will be
                  ok.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
                  have cooked a small amount of rice to throw in along with the
                  tin of
                  veg
                  soup and an onion (extra onion and tin of soup added for
                  Linda's
                  portion) and served with a small tin bread loaf - It should at
                  least be
                  filling ;-)<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I still have 2 days to go and only 78p left !<br>
                  Stock check:<br>
                  &nbsp; 1 packets of biscuits<br>
                  &nbsp; 1 x small tin loaf&nbsp; (plus a few slices of the
                  Hovis loaf)<br>
                  &nbsp; 1/2 kg of rice<br>
                  &nbsp; 1/2 jar of jam<br>
                  &nbsp; 5 x onions<br>
                  &nbsp; lots of tea bags (Anyone who thinks I am not really
                  suffering I
                  suggest you try one of these tea bags ;-)<br>

                  Yesterday's meal didn't go down too well, very bland would
                  pretty much
                  sum it up.<br>
                  <br>
                  Had some toast and jam for breakfast today (and maybe the odd
                  biscuit
                  ;-)<br>
                  I will cycle over to Long Eaton today and check out Asda
                  again, this
                  seems to be the best place for the cheaper stuff, Sainsbury's
                  being the
                  worst.&nbsp; Hopefully find something good to spend my
                  remaining 78p on.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mid day</span><br>
                  Failed to find anything new, so for dinner it will be rice, <a

                  dinner was surprisingly good (and lots of it), not bad
                  considering it's
                  total cost was 36p.&nbsp; With a few veg. added it would be a
                  perfectly
                  acceptable meal even if I was not doing this challenge.&nbsp;
                  I had

                    target="_blank">cheap rice</a> was terrible first time I
                  tried it, but
                  actually it is ok.<br>

                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">6pm</span><br>
                  Great news?&nbsp;&nbsp; My first target of £250 has now been
                  reached so
                  I am now on this challenge for an extra 5 days!<br>
                  Next target is £500, if this is reached then it is 15 days!<br>

                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">8pm</span><br>
                  I bagged 3 more of the 25p loaves :-) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
                  plan to only
                  count the cost of these as and when I use them, I have to buy
                  them when
                  I can<br>
                  I experimented with oats and much to my surprise found that
                  porridge
                  made with water is surprisingly good - so I bought myself 500g
                  of oats
                  for 39p<br>
                  So I will have a bowl of water based porridge with jam before
                  bed :-)<br>

                  porridge made
                  with water and a dollop of jam.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">1pm</span><br>
                  Went
                  to the pub at lunch with the chaps from work (even though I
                  couldn't
                  eat or drink anything there), Melvin kindly managed to get a
                  pint of
                  tap water for me foc so at least I had something to drink
                  whilst
                  watching them all eat their dinner.<br>
                  On the way home after the pub I bought a tin of speghetti
                  (16p) and had
                  this with the tin of potatoes I bought on Wed.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">5pm</span><br>
                  Just realised I messed up!&nbsp; I had planned to buy a jar of
                  curry
                  sauce for this evenings meal.&nbsp; Luckily I still have a
                  small loaf
                  left so I can do something with that but I am very low on jam
                  so
                  nothing much to put on it. <br>
                  Just realised; if I put the 25p loaf I back into store this
                  frees up
                  25p and so I can have a 18p jar of curry instead and then have
                  a slap
                  up curry and rice with onion tonight :-)<br>

                  Lunch was another bowl of porridge and also a few biscuits
                  with a
                  "nice" cup
                  of tea later on (well, that was the plan - next thing I knew I
                  didn't
                  have many biscuits left ;-)<br>
                  <br>
                  This evenings meal consists of yet another curry sauce (18p),
                  an onion,
                  couple of small potatoes and a small loaf (21p as it was
                  damaged as
                  well as nearly out of date) - I admit an odd meal but I am too
                  tired to
                  do much else.....<br>

                  <br>
                  I will be going shopping this morning to see what I can find
                  for todays
                  exciting meals.<br>
                  <br>
                  I bought the following:&nbsp; A jar of sweet and sour sauce
                  28p, a tin
                  of kidney beans 21p (as I have been advised I need some
                  protein) and a bag of oats 75p - plus I have brought out
                  another of my
                  small loaves. 23p<br>
                  <br>
                  During the day I had a load of bread and jam, this evenings
                  meal will
                  be
                  sweet and sour sauce with rice (with added onion and kidney
                  beans)<br>

                  I had hoped the sweet and sour sauce would make a nice change,
                  but it
                  was pretty unpleasant.&nbsp; Maybe this evening I will see
                  what I can
                  do with the potatoes I have.&nbsp; Bread seems to be the only
                  thing I
                  have eaten so far which could be described as nice.&nbsp; If I
                  had
                  cooking oil I think things would improve but it is just too
                  expensive.&nbsp; <br>
                  Porridge for breakfast again.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: bold;">11am</span><br>
                  I have given up on any hope of a healthy diet - so bought some
                  biscuits
                  for 23p and spent 21p on bread, prob. have some toast later.<br>
                  Times are hard now, I am having to use my tea bags twice to
                  make them
                  last the full 10 days.<br>
                  <br>
                  This evenings meal will be boiled potatoes with a tin of mushy
                  peas
                  (12p)<br>

                  anything to
                  work for my lunch so I had to blow 19p on a banana from
                  Sainsburys!<br>
                  <br>
                  Still nearly £200 to go before I reach my next target and then
                  have
                  another 5 days to do, so I think I am safe to assume tomorrow
                  will be
                  my last day (although maybe I am tempting fate and I will
                  actually be
                  on this challenge for the rest of my life!).&nbsp; <br>
                  I have some food already paid for (potatoes etc.) and £1.06
                  left to
                  spend so I should be able to relax a bit now - who knows,
                  maybe even
                  see if I can buy a 30p bar of chocolate tomorrow from Tesco as
                  a reward
                  to myself :-)<br>
                  <br>
                  For this evenings meal&nbsp; I will bring out yet another of
                  my Coop
                  23p loaves of bread (I don't know what I would have done
                  without these)
                  and have a tin of soup with it (23p) and the remaining kidney
                  beans
                  from the other night.&nbsp; This will leave lots of
                  potatoes (probably too many actually) for tomorrows evening
                  meal.<br>
                  <br>
                  I am looking forward to being able to return to my old life:
                  not having
                  to make my excuses when people suggest I go for a coffee with
                  them; not
                  having to just sit and watch whilst friends have a drink and a
                  meal in
                  the
                  pub; not walking round shops looking at what I could have if
                  only
                  I had another 20p; being able to have a drink with Linda when
                  we
                  have a meal; and most of all, being able to drink coffee
                  again.<br>

                <td style="vertical-align: top;">My challenge is over! - I plan
                  to allow myself a
                  brief period of excess (both food and alcohol ;-)<br>
                  This mornings breakfast - £1.35<br>
                  <br>
                  What I have learned is that whilst I thought I was already
                  living on a
                  low income, I now really appreciate that I am still living a
                  very
                  privileged/exercessive life (may be difficult to remember in
                  winter
                  when I can't afford to have the central heating on ;-).&nbsp;
                  I have
                  had a small glimpse of
                  just how depressing and excluding being truly poor must
                  be.&nbsp; Even
                  though
                  this was a very artificial excercise without any of the real
                  stresses
                  of how I will survive or if I am going to lose my home etc. I
                  was still
                  finding it very depressing and hard work and I am very pleased
                  it is
                  over.<br>
                  <br>
                  I feel I should be doing more than I am which is why I decided
                  to take part in this challenge, but not sure sponsored events
                  is "it", I just don't have the personality required to ask
                  people for
                  money - it felt to me a bit like I was trying to exploit
                  friends/collegues.&nbsp;
                  Also, I don't think many people would stand for me doing
                  something like
                  this on a regular basis ;-)<br>
                  I will consider what else I could do?<br>
                  <br>
                  One thing I have learned during this is that porridge made
                  with water is just as good if not better than made with soya
                  milk.<br>
