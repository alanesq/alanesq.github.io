        <div style="text-align: left;"><big> I decided to take a look into the
            ethics of the way I live my life a while ago, here are the results
            so far:<br>
          </big><br>
          I don't pretend for one moment to be living an ethical life, but I
          thought it something I should at least be working towards, or at least
          it should have some bearing on the decisions I make on the way I live
          my life.<br>
          BTW - I don't want to give the impression I am judging anyone else
          here - I am just taking a moment to judge myself, as I believe
          Socrates said "the life which is unexamined is not worth living".<br>

      As my main guide to this subject I have taken the opinions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer"
        target="_blank">Peter Singer </a>who I have a great deal of respect for
      <small>(and I tend to agree with pretty much all he says on this and other
        subjects)</small><br>
      In fact, I don't think anything Peter Singer has said/written has been
      news to me, it rather has just legitimised what I was already thinking
      myself but no one else seemed to agree with me and I therfore didn't have
      the confidence to follow where it was leading me.<br>

                  have for some time now had this increasing feeling that the
                  privileged life I am living here in the developed world can
                  not be morally justified when there are lots of people dying
                  around the world due to extreme poverty. &nbsp;The basic
                  question which keeps coming back to me is; &nbsp;how can
                  morally justify spending £2.50 on a coffee&nbsp;when there are
                  millions of people living in extreme poverty in the world <small>(in
                    fact many people have less than this a day to live on) </small>.<br>
                  <br>
                  I detail here my conclusions and actions on this question
                  partly as a way of getting it clear in my own head but also in
                  the hope that it may inspire others to seriously look at this
                  question themselves........<small>also, and probably most
                    importantly if I post to the world my intentions here then I
                    can't change my mind later on ;-)<br>
                    <br>
                  </small></span></big>I have periodically worried about this
              question <small>(probably for several years now)</small> but when
              I ask others for advice I am usually told not to worry about it,
              it is not my problem, there is nothing a single person can do it
              is the government who should take action, I am entitled to the
              life I have&nbsp;etc. etc. and I usually sort of accept this and
              forget about it again. &nbsp;but, a lot like when I eventually
              decided to go vegan - the question just keeps coming back into my
              head and each time it was more difficult to shake off.<br>
              I used to give a small amount to charities but I became
              disillusioned as I was concerned that a lot of what I was giving
              would be going to pay large management salaries etc. and not
              actually getting to the people I intended the money for <small>(this
                may have partly just been&nbsp;a convenient excuse?)</small>, so
              I stopped giving all together.</div>

    I recently discovered that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer"
      target="_blank">Peter Singer</a>&nbsp;has written a book on this very
    subject <a href="http://thelifeyoucansave.com/" target="_blank">The life
      you can save</a> so I ordered a copy asap in the hope this would put my
    mind at rest. <br>
    Sadly it just confirmed everything I had already suspected and basically the
    life I am leading <span style="font-weight: bold;">is</span> immoral as I
    am living in relative luxury with a house, no fear of starvation, a police
    force to protect me and top quality medical care and spending large sums of
    money on things I do not need whilst other people die for the want of the
    most basic of human needs :-(<br>
    <small>- This proved to be a very expensive book purchase ;-)</small><br>
    <br>
    See Peter Singer at Ted <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism"
      target="_blank">HERE</a>.&nbsp; Peter singer on poverty <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1K-XVmmuUo"
      target="_blank">HERE</a>.<br>
    Also see <a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org" target="_blank">givingwhatwecan.org</a>
    which is a similar scheme by Toby Ord (who can be seen at Tedx <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGAkrpwyu1k#t=833"
      target="_blank">HERE</a>)<br>
    <br>
    I am by no means rich <small>(by our standards)</small>, I only work part
    time and I can not even afford to run my central heating for most of the
    winter but even so I spend £2.50 several time a week on a drink of coffee, I
    recently spent £300 on a "new" bicycle just because I fancied a change, I go
    on holiday twice a year and I like most just ignore the fact that there are
    millions of people living in extreme poverty. &nbsp;<br>
    If people living next door were starving I would not hesitate for a moment
    to help them and I would clearly be a&nbsp;bad person if I did, but for some
    reason because the starving are in another country I do nothing - It was
    time to really take a look at the way I am living........<br>
    <br>
    What Peter Singer suggests is you give around 5% of your salary to charity <small>(varying
      depending on how much you earn)</small> and then if everyone did this the
    funds provided would be enough to make &nbsp;real difference, this way you
    are at least doing your part. &nbsp;Whilst I agree with this it still didn't
    feel for me that I would be doing enough, it still felt like I was just
    giving myself an excuse to try to forget about the problem again...
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I originally came up with a plan that I would give the same&nbsp;amount
    every time I spend&nbsp;on what I consider a luxury - I did this for a while
    but predictably this eventually just became a lot of paperwork which didn't
    really achieve anything practical, just made me feel better spending money
    on luxuries<small> (as every time I did some money also went to a charity) <big>and
        I ended up just avoiding luxuries</big></small>. &nbsp;So I have now
    just decided to give 10% of whatever I earn. &nbsp;This results in about the
    same amount going to a charity but considerably less time spent
    administering it.<br>
    <br>
    BTW - this is not as big a deal as it may first sound, it is not going to
    change my life in any significant way, in fact to be honest it is simply the
    least I fell I can do.<br>
    <br>
    This is by no stretch of the imagination going to result in my living an
    ethical&nbsp; life but there is a line towards the end of Peter Singers book
    which gave me some comfort:<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-jsid="text" class="commentBody"><span
        class="text_exposed_show">"Instead of worrying about how much you would
        have to do in order to live a fully ethical life, do something that is
        significantly more than you have been doing so far - then see how that
        feels...."</span></span><br>
    So I will give this a try&nbsp;:-)<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"></span>BTW - the
    concerns I originally had about any money I give to charities being wasted
    on salaries etc. can be resolved by checking out <a href="http://givewell.org"
      target="_blank">GiveWell</a>:<br>
    They evaluate how well the money from charities is used and list the top
    rated charities.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong.html"
      target="_blank">THIS</a> Ted talk is very interesting on this subject<br>
    When discussing this subject I am finding that this is the excuse many other
    people use for not giving <small>(as I did)</small>, it is a very easy and
    convenient reason not to do anything, but it simple is not valid. &nbsp;Of
    course some of what you give will go on admin, staff salaries, fund raising,
    checking they are actually producing good results etc. but these are things
    which have to be done.&nbsp; Of course if this was really the reason we did
    not give then we could just spend a bit of time finding a way we can help
    rather than just wash our hands of any responsibility.<br>
    btw - see <a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/tabid/107/ID/79/Why-Do-Donors-Worry-About-High-Salaries.aspx"
      target="_blank">THIS</a> for some really good info on charity admin/large
    salaries.<br>
    <br>
    Another argument I hear about saving lives is that this will just increase
    the worlds population and cause more problems - If you wonder about this
    then please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTznEIZRkLg" target="_blank">THIS</a>

    <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/why-give/myths-about-aid" target="_blank">see
      Myths about Aid</a><br>
    <br>
    I spent some time pondering which charity to give to but as Givewell is very
    U.S. biased I thought that the lack of being able to use Gift Aid and the
    fees the credit card company is likely to charge will result in a lot of
    what I give not getting to the charity. &nbsp;So I now give 10% of my wages
    to Oxfam.<br>
    <br>
    It is of course very easy to just give a bit of money, but what else am I
    doing?<br>
    This is a question I pondered and as I result I tried doing a sponsored
    event (details <a href="lbtl" target="_blank">HERE</a>).&nbsp;
It
    was an interesting experience but I just don't have the personality required
    to go round asking people for money etc.&nbsp; I raised some money for Oxfam
    but it felt a bit like exploiting friends.&nbsp; If I am to do something
    more, I think I need to find something else.<br>
    <br>
    Christianity of course does have the true ethical answer&nbsp; (I don't
    often find myself agreeing with religions) where Jusus clearly states that
    all your possessions should be given to the poor (Mark 10 13-25).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">My phone related adventure (Aug13)</span><br>
    I recently decided it was really time I bought a new cellphone asm mine is
    now very out of date.....I eventually decided to buy a Google Nexus as they
    were on offer and so after much pondering I finally went for it and ordered
    one....&nbsp; Well, this is not actually true, I did try but when I came to
    the final step and clicked on the "PAY" button it came back with an error
    saying my payment couldn't be taken and I should try again later. <br>
    Whilst waiting I started to ponder on the idea that I am just about to spend
    several hundred pounds to replace a perfectly serviceable and I know the new
    one will seem just as out of date in a matter of months and I will be
    looking at throwing it away and buy the latest model again.&nbsp; The amount
    of money I was about to spend on upgrading my phone would be totally life
    changing for a lot of people....<br>
    So instead of buying this new phone I decided to keep my old phone and use
    the money to pay for a woman's life changing surgery via <a href="http://www.fistulafoundation.org/"
      target="_blank">www.fistulafoundation.org</a>.&nbsp; so now whilst some
    people may look down on my old Windows v6 phone I am VERY proud of it and I
    plan to keep it for many years to come :-)<br>
    - Wouldn't this be a great trend to start.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experience so far (May14)</span><br>
    One unexpected result of my deciding to give some of my wealth to the poor
    has been the loss of a very good friend.&nbsp; I am not really clear on why
    but it seems he was so angered that I give to charity despite his continued
    assertions that all the money I give will be wasted that he has told me
    never to try and contact him again.<br>
    I guess this is partly my fault because I am so vocal about what I give but
    I made the decision to do this as I think it important as it may encourage
    others to do the same, if I just kept quiet about it then of course he would
    never have known and so could not get upset by it....Sill very sad that this
    has happened.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Feb16</span><br>
    I am retiring in a couple of months and as I wil no longer have an income
    (not a traditional retirement) I will no longer be contributing any
    significant amount to Oxfam, but hopefully I will start getting some income
    in the not too distant future and will be able to start again.<br>

          </span></big></span></big><br>
    With global warming and the ever increasing world population I really need
    to try and reduce my negative impact on the world.<br>
    <br>
    One of the worst things you can do f
    <h1 align="center"><big><big><font color="#ff0000"><a href="http://fistulafoundation.org/"><img
                style="border: 0px solid ; width: 350px; height: 157px;" alt="ethics2"
                src="file:///run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share:server=ha1,share=mydocs/My%20Webs/ALANESQ.com/ethics/ethics2.jpg"></a></font></big></big></h1>
    or the environment is have children, this is something I have managed to
    avoid so good start there. &nbsp;A couple of years ago I sold my motorbikes
    and put my car into storage and went back to cycling. &nbsp;A good part of
    the reasons for doing this was that it just seems to me that cars have just
    got totally out of hand, there are just too many of them. &nbsp;i.e. The age
    of car ownership has passed. &nbsp;It does seem to me that we are now living
    in a vast car park. &nbsp;<br>
    I have a selection of trailers for my cycle <small>(see <a href="http://alanesq.com/trailer.htm"
        target="_blank">HERE</a>)</small> and find I can live without a car no
    problem at all, in fact life is so much less stressful when you do not have
    a car&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I am already doing my bit of reducing my use of fossil fuels to heat my
    house simply by the fact I can not afford it - It does seem to me some times
    that most of the cause of global warming is simply the rich part of the
    world has too much money? &nbsp; It is not that long ago that almost no one
    had a car and we did not heat the entire house all the time.........<br>
    <br>
    I do tend to use a lot of electricity though. &nbsp;Much of this is down to
    my home automation system which has a PC running 24hrs a day (costing around
    £6 a week). &nbsp;<br>
    I also generate a surprising amount of rubbish <small>(aka trash)</small>,
    so this is something which needs looking at.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    So all in all, I am already doing a lot for this but still plenty of room
    for improvement I am sure.<br>

so
    I think I am already doing a lot for this cause - still plenty more I could
    be doing though, especially with regard to blood sports.<br>
    <br>
    I am still unsure about vivisection and I really need to spend some time
    learning more on the subject to come to a decision of where I stand.<br>
