            There are three cash registers available, free to a good home.
            <br>They are all All located at Dunstable for 
            collection.  Please let me know on the forum if you are interested and only if you are serious, able to 
            collect and will turn up on time as arranged etc..  It would be preferable if all three were to go at the 
            same time.

              <br>Found in the middle of the road at Holborn, London, at 9PM. I picked it up, and reported it to the Police, 
              but they were not interested.(When I found the portion of an aircraft wing in the same area at about the same 
              time, again no interest!) This machine could be used as a bitser.

              <br>This one is electric, with four drawers, as used by the Browns of Chester department store. It was operating, 
              and I suspect the pink paint finish of the wooden base is not original, but tied in with a colour scheme in 
              one of the stores departments.
