      <p><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">Air conditioners can still be
          very expensive bits of kit in this country and if you don't have
          several hundred pounds to spend then a simple fan can make a big
          difference to how "intolerable" the hot weather can seem. Get the
          biggest fan you can and get it as soon as you can because if you wait
          until the hot weather arrives you won't be able to find one in the
          shops.<br>
          The problem with a fan is that when the weather gets really hot it
          will just be blowing hot air onto you and not helping, in the more
          mild heat they can help a lot though.</font></p>
      <a href="aircon/howtheywork.htm" target="_blank">Here</a> is a simple
      explanation of how the air conditioner works<br>

                      size="3">There are a couple of air conditioners being sold
                      in DIY shops etc. which are a portable unit with a large
                      air pipe you stick out of the window, they tend to cost
                      from 100 to 300 ukp. In my opinion these units are of very
                      little use and I wouldn't recommend buying one as they are
                      really nothing more than a personal cooling fan </font><font
                      face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">(if you have one of
                      these units please let me know what you think of it?). </font><br>
                  </div>
                  <font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">I bought myself the
                    smaller model (3500btu)&nbsp; good many years ago for 500
                    ukp and even though it was only in a 9 foot square room it
                    was unable to lower the temperature of the room at all,
                    eventually the compressor failed and I couldn't find anyone
                    who would repair it for less than the unit cost new so I had
                    to throw it away. <br>
                    These units work by sucking air in from the room over the
                    condenser (hot part of the air conditioner) and out of the
                    window through a pipe, so hot air is going to be sucked back
                    into the room to replace the air blown out of the window,
                    also the units tend to get hot themselves and this also adds
                    to the heat of the room.<br>
                    Note - There are units which have two air pipes out of the
                    window, one sucks air in the other blows it back out
                    again.&nbsp; I suspect these units are better but I have not
                    seen one in action to know for sure?</font></td>

                    is a "split portable" unit, which can be moved from room to
                    room, but instead of just putting an air pipe out of the
                    window you put a large box (the condenser) outside </font><font

                    I have had a couple of these units and I can confirm that
                    they work very well (a bit noisier than an installed aircon
                    as the compressor is still inside the room but I am very
                    impressed with it)<br>
                    They can suffer from freezing up as the components are so
                    compact, but they are a massive improvement on the above
                    type &nbsp;Some you can disconnect the pipes so they could
                    then be passed through a small hole in the wall.<br>

      <p><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">If you look at air conditioners
          in America they are much cheaper than over here, so after some
          searching I found a company in America who said they could supply me
          with one which would work in the UK but when I started asking to buy
          it they seemed to get difficult and wouldn't accept payment by credit
          card so I gave up on this idea. </font><font face="Arial, sans-serif"
          size="2">(I have since been told that as their units will not be CE
          approved they are not allowed to sell them to us over here?)</font><font
          face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><br>
          I understand that although other countries sell some 240volt equipment
          they can use slightly different voltages and frequencies to us and
          this may cause problems if you try and use the units over here ?</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">I myself was just about to order one of
          the split portable units&nbsp;for £1000 <small>(this was around 15
            years ago)</small> when I received an email from </font><a href="http://www.lake-ref.co.uk/"
          target="_blank"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Lake Refrigeration</font></a>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">(In Watnall near Nottingham) saying they
          could supply me with an installed type room air conditioner (ie the
          sort you see in shops which is bolted to the wall and has a big
          condenser outside) of 9000 btu for around 600 ukp, I took them up on
          this offer and now have the unit installed and I am extremely pleased
          with it </font><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">(I have now
          had this for over 3 years and am still very happy with it)</font><font
          face="Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Lake delivered it to my house, I installed the units myself and then
          Lake came back and did the final checks and commissioning for me as
          this involves the use of a vacuum pump and other specialist equipment
          and the final cost including all pipes etc. was around 750 ukp.<br>
          The installation involves screwing the unit to the wall, knocking a
          half brick sized hole in the wall, basic mains wiring and routing the
          two copper pipes between the inside and outside unit all of which I
          did in a single day without any problems </font><font face="Arial, sans-serif"
          size="2">(Lake can do all this for you but this will of course
          increase the price)</font></p>

          We use the "Split portable" units in our hire fleet and they have
          proven successful with hirers and have been reliable.&nbsp; However
          reliability appears to be related to initial cost.&nbsp; Same old
          story " You get what you pay for".<br>
          The comment regarding fan noise emanating from the window units, this
          noise appears inherent with to this type of unit and as a consequence
          this type of unit has a nickname in the trade of; " window rattlers".<br>
          At the larger floor areas of the sizing program the result appears to
          under size the cooling unit. Generally the quick rule of thumb used in
          the trade utilises the room volume not area.</font></p>

          David Rice)<br>
          The tower type fans are very good.<br>
          I have bought a ceiling fan and it certainly feels cooler in my room
          now.&nbsp; Its silent running so you can leave it on overnight, it did
          wobble on the highest speed but there's a balancing kit with it and so
          I balanced it and now it just wobbles a little. &nbsp;Its on a ball
          and socket joint so the bracket takes the wobble not the roof beam.
          &nbsp; It does need an earth wire.&nbsp; I got my fan from B&amp;Q,
          the price range is anything from 19.99 to 100ukp.&nbsp;</font></p>
