            much as

            be killed or harmed to produce.<big><font size="2"><big><br>
                  Basically,
                  all I am trying to do is live my life without killing or
                  harming
                  anything, it is depressing how difficult this
                  simple goal is to achieve in our society.<br>

                  Something which I suspect puts a lot of people off going
                  veggie is they
                  think they will have to eat "healthy food" for the rest of
                  their life
                  (i.e. salads etc.), if you go to a veggie restaurant this is
                  exactly
                  what
                  you will find is offered but I can assure you it doesn't have
                  to
                  be like that.&nbsp; Despite being vegan for some 15 years I
                  still very
                  easily maintain my obese status and I love nothing more than a
                  large
                  serving of pie, chips and mushy peas followed with apple pie

                I AM VEGGIE</span><br>
            </strong></big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big><strong>About 20 years ago I decided to go
              vegetarian.&nbsp; I slowly came to the decision to do so for a
              number of reasons:</strong></big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big>- I realised
            that if I was given a live animal
            there is no way I would kill it and eat it, so I felt it was wrong
            of me to get someone else to do
            it for
            me and just pretend it wasn't really happening.</big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big>- I felt
            that feeding on another animals flesh
            was just something wild animals do, I don't feel it something
            I as a supposed civilised person should be
            doing. &nbsp;There is simply no need in this day and age.</big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big>- I like
            other animals and don't wish to harm them.</big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big>- I consider
            the way farm animals are treated to
            be far beyond barbaric.&nbsp; You may imagine farm animals to be
            kept
            as in the books you read at school, <span style="font-weight: bold;">but
they
              are not</span>.<br>
            &nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxdQKvp-S0Q" target="_blank">Just
              watch this video of u.k. slaughter
              houses</a> -&nbsp;<span style="color: red;">Warning
              - it is grim viewing</span>.</big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big>I find it an
            unexplainable contradiction that
            to kill and eat a dog it is a very bad thing, but to do this to a
            pig
            is
            "normal" and so OK. &nbsp;Pigs are one of the most
            intelligent animals, in fact more intelligent than
            dogs&nbsp;<small>
              (Many Victorians kept pigs as pets, as do
              some people now.&nbsp; In fact I would like one myself but I know
              what
              I would do if DEFRA came to kill it as they did to pet pigs in the
              last
              Foot and Mouth outbreak)</small><br>
            btw - Apparently human flesh is very similar to pig, this is why
            some
            cannibals referred to human flesh as
            "long pork"</big></font></big></p>

              15 years ago&nbsp;I found I was increasingly
              asking myself the following questions:</strong></big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big>- If we
            assume that for every hen or cow produced
            there is also a male born (cockerel or bull), then where do they all
            go?&nbsp;</big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big>- For a cow
            to produce milk she has to give birth
            every year, what happens to all these calves?</big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big>- What
            happens to milk and egg producing animals
            when they stop producing?</big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big>- Are the
            milk and egg producing animals well
            cared for ?</big></font></big></p>

                sink in the quest to make money from farming animals - but I had

    <p><big><font size="2"><big>People seem
            to have the impression that farm
            animals are somehow a lower order than the animals we keep as
            pets.&nbsp; This I think is partly because farm animals tend to
            be very dirty and smelly but this is of course just because of
            the conditions they are forced to live in <small>(e.g. keep 50
              cats in a
              small house and you will soon see them in a different light)</small><br>
            When I was about 13 I owned a couple of chickens as pets.&nbsp; I
            had many different pets during my childhood but I found the
            chickens to be the best, they would recognise me and run over
            calling to be picked up etc. just as any pet would.&nbsp; <br>
            e.g.
            Early one Sunday morning I was woken up as one of them had come
            over to the house and was calling very loudly which was very
            strange behaviour for them, after looking out of my bedroom window
            I was unable to see what was wrong and she would not shut up so
            eventually I had to get up and go and see what the problem
            was.&nbsp; I picked her up but could see no problem, after a
            while I put her down and she wondered off happily.&nbsp; The only
            conclusion I could come to was she had felt lonely and wanted
            picking up?<br>
            So now when I see battery hens on TV you can imagine how it looks
            to me as I know the truth.</big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big>If you want
            more evidence I suggest you see <a href="http://www.hillside.org.uk/"
              target="_top">Hillside
              animal sanctuary</a> as they can supply DVDs of their

      new vegans </span><br>
    <br>
    <big><font size="2"><big>
          Living your life without harming any other animal is actually not
          possible </big></font></big><big><font size="2"><big> (e.g. have you
          seen what quantity of the flour we eat is actually made up of beetle
          parts - more info <a href="http://www.sixwise.com/newsletters/05/06/29/how_many_insect_parts_and_rodent_hairs_are_allowed_in_your_food.htm"
            target="_blank">HERE</a>) </big></font></big><big><font size="2"><big>so
being
          vegan is always going to be a goal rather than an acheivement,
          even now after all these years I am still discovering things I had
          thought were ok are actually not.&nbsp; So my advice to anyone
          thinking
          of becoming vegan is not to get too bogged down with the details and
          just start cutting out the obvious things.&nbsp; It is always going to
          be a work in progress.......the thing to focus on is the harm you have
          now stopped doing.<br>

have
          recently started selling the large flavored Alpro yoghurts which
          are VERY good. Tescos now do a good range of own brand vegan cheeses
          and their own yoghurt but I find them to be very poor.</span><br data-reactid=".c8.1:3:1:$comment881938525156238_882212035128887:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$9:0">

          label a few of their items as vegan (the country pies and
          basic sausages) but even I think of these as unhealthy foods.&nbsp; </span><span

grab

      <big><font size="2"><big><small>BTW- just to clarify - I am not
              totally decided how I stand on vivisectionist, I fully realise
              that
              medical science
              can not progress without animal experiments and should I fall
              seriously
              ill I will not refuse treatment, but I do consider that the vast
              majority of vivisection carried out at the moment is not at all
              justified and where possible alternatives should be found.&nbsp; I
              figure there is a very big difference between killing something
              because
              you choose to eat it rather than a freely available alternative or
              for
              fun and killing something in the hope you will save millions of
              human
              lives as a result.&nbsp; I fully admit this is a subject I need to
              look
              into more but until then I am willing to keep at least a partially
              open
              mind on the subject?</small></big></font></big></p>
