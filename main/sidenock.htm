          <td style="vertical-align: top;"> We have very little information on
            the&nbsp;nocks used on Medieval longbows, but by an amazing stroke
            of luck one of the horn nocks used on the Mary Rose bows did survive
            -<small> I know this is Tudor but its the nearest we have</small><br>
            I say a stroke of luck because they were made of horn and very
            little horn survived. <br>
            Marks can be clearly seen on the Mary
            Rose bow tips where the nocks had been fitted but none of the bows
            had any horn nock remaining.&nbsp; <br>
            The single nock which was recovered was not fitted to a bow but was
            found wrapped up and so protected.<br>
            If it wasn't for this single find then we would know practically
            nothing about the nocks they used.&nbsp; <br>

    Why this is so important is the fact that the nocks they used turn out to
    be&nbsp;nothing at all like the ones used today.......<br>
    It wasn't until I visited the Mary Rose and saw this nock for myself that it
    really struck me just how completely different their&nbsp;nocks were to
    anything I had seen before.<br>
    No one seemed to know anything about it, in fact it seemed that people were
    just completely ignoring it, so I set about trying to find out how and why
    these nocks were used. &nbsp;This page is basically what I have learned so
    far about them and my experiences of using them on my own bows. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    As far as I can tell all longbows had sidenocks until around the Victorian
    era when for some reason they changed to using the more familiar modern
    type. &nbsp;So if you want a replica medieval longbow then sidenocks are a
    must.<br>

    As you can see, this is nothing like the nocks used on&nbsp;longbows now.
    &nbsp;You can't see from these pictures but the far side of this nock is
    smooth, it is a basically just a smooth horn tip with&nbsp;a single slot cut
    down one side <small>(hence side nock)</small><br>
    The slot goes right through the horn and into the wood of the bow tip <small>(as
can
      be clearly seen on the second picture) </small>&nbsp;and there is a lip
    on the bottom edge of the slot&nbsp;<br>

      Big thanks to Lee of &nbsp;<a href="http://www.heritage-longbows.co.uk/" target="_blank">Heritage-Longbows</a>
      for showing me how to use a sidenock with a loop as I had been completely
      unable to figure this out, I had been using a noose on my string up to
      this point although I had always strongly suspected this was wrong.<br>
      The secret to using a loop is the lip on the bottom edge of the nocks
      string slot which helps holds the string in place - I had thought this was
      just for when using a stringer but it turns out to be a vital feature of
      the side nock<br>

        The above is the first time I have tried a second slot for the bracer,
        it works really well even with a large loop on the bracer string.
        &nbsp;I had suspected it would get in the way of the bow string but this
        is not the case at all.<br>
        BTW - This explains why a few of the Mary Rose bows have a double slot
        in the bow tip. &nbsp;<br>
        i.e. I didn't go right through to the bow wood with the second slot but
        I would imagine that sometimes if the horn is thinner then you would<br>
        <br>
        This nock is made from deer antler <small>(naturally shed so no animal
          was killed to get it, but its unpleasntly smelly stuff to work - think
          I will stick to plastic in future)</small><br>

      <div style="text-align: center;">I happened to have some naturally shed
        antler tips which were given to me some time ago and when you look at
        one of these next to one of my&nbsp;nocks I think you will agree its
        pretty conclusive that the nocks were&nbsp;just the end sawn off a horn
        or antler, drilled, stuck on the bow tip and a slot cut down one side -
        simple ! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <small>(well, maybe smoothed a bit as

    <br>
    The obvious question when you see a sidenock is why were they used.<br>
    This is a question I have pondered a lot and I can't give a simple answer, I
    suspect that the real question should be why have we recently converted from
    sidenocks to the ones we use now? &nbsp; I would guess the answer to this is
    likely to be that we are using different string materials and mostly much
    lighter bows.<br>
    One thing which I think may be significant is the way the slot goes right
    through the nock into the wood of the bow tip - I wonder if the a reason for
    doing this is so that the string actually holds the nock in place so if the
    glue fails then the nock will still work. &nbsp;I have tried using a bow
    with the nock not glued on like this and it does work ok. &nbsp;I have been
    informed that glues of the time would be very strong but not water proof.<br>
    I have heard it suggested that sidenocks prevent the bow twisting but I
    don't know if there is any truth in this idea but with sidenocks the string
    does tend to sit to one side of the bow tip resulting in the bow string
    going diagonally along the bow - maybe this is significant ?<br>
    Now I am using them with a loop I find they are very easy to string and the
    nocks are very easy to make - so maybe the answer is simply they are the
    easiest and most reliable way to make a nock?<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whatever the reason the fact is that if you
      want an authentic Medieval/Tudor copy longbow then sidenocks are the only
      option</span><br>
    <br>
    I don't know why but sidenocks seem to have been almost completely ignored
    by&nbsp;modern longbow archers - It is now very slowly starting to be taken
    up, but still it is extremely rare to see anyone using sidenocks, even when
    they claim to be using a replica Mary Rose bow?<br>
    I know a few people have experimented with them and I know of three other
    people who use them on a regular basis but basically any longbow you buy<small>
      (even if based on a Mary Rose bow)</small> will have&nbsp;what I call
    "Victorian type" nocks. <small>(This is not the bowyers fault, they give
      the customer what they want, its up to us to start asking for them)</small><br>
    <br>
    So I have created this page in the hope it will get people interested in the
    side nock and maybe get more people using them<br>
    I have been using them on all my bows for a couple of years now<small> (up
      to 140lb at 32")</small> and I can assure you they work very well and
    there is no reason not to be using them<br>
    <br>
    I predict that in a few years time it will start to seem very odd to see a
    longbow with anything other than sidenocks<br>

      Some info&nbsp;from Hauke Gipp</span><br>
    <br>
    I'm a traditional archer from Holland <br>
    We have been to Portsmouth (last july) where we were invited to the Mary
    Rose museum and the museum archives.&nbsp;I saw the only surviving horn nock
    and the tips of the bows, one thing was clear to me: They used sidenocks
    reenforced with horn!<br>
    I have known side nocks on longbows for several years. I have been shooting
    a Hedeby (Haithabu) replica bow for some years now. The original(s) dating
    from the 8th/9th century a.d.&nbsp;are of Viking origin. They had one side
    nock carved into the yewwood of the upper limb and no nock (slot) on the
    lower limb. There had been a knot to hold the string. There was a nail in
    the back of the upper limb to hold the string when unstrung. The bow(s) had
    an estimated drawweight of about 80 to 90 lbs and with respect to the
    archaeological record of arrowheads found together with the bows, they
    should be regarded as weapons of war.<br>
    <br>
    In a museum very close to the place where those bows were excavated I saw
    some other longbows which had been excavated some km's north in Southern
    Denmark. In a peatbog close to the village of Nydam three ships and a lot of
    gear and weapons were found which are regarded as a sacrifices after battles
    were won. Among the weapons there were about 40 longbows, made from yew and
    some of elm, of which several had a spike made of antler, bone or even iron
    fixed to the top of the upper limb, which characterizes them also as weapons
    of war. Those bows had sidenocks as well and I made a replica of a Nydam bow
    - from Hickory :o( The archaeological finds date from 240 to 400 a.d. and
    are of Germanic origin.<br>
    <br>
    I think sidenocks are the first type of nock used on longbows and with bows
    going heavier throughout the Middle-ages using horn provided good protection
    for the tips against both, bowstrings cutting through relatively soft
    yewwood and damage of the tips due to transport and battle.<br>
    <br>
    The sidenocks of all three different types of longbow work well with Flemish
    loops if they are tight enough. On the Viking bow replica a linen thread was
    used to whip just beneath the nock to prevent the string from cutting into
    the wood. I think, because of the much better quality of yew there was no
    such whipping on the original bows.<br>

      The bright coloured bow with the antlerpoint is the Nydam (it should be
      Yew but this one I made from Hickory). It is about 60lb@28''. The one with
      the thread binding is my old Hedeby (was 65lb@28'')&nbsp; and the one with
      the cowhorn is the ELB I made some weeks ago (70lb@28'')<br>

      Questions still to be answered</span><br>
    <br>
    In Roger Ascham's Toxophilus (<a href="http://www.archerylibrary.com/books/toxophilus/"
      target="_blank">see here</a>) there is the following paragraph<br>
    <br>
    "Great strings and little strings be for divers purposes : the great string
    is more surer for the bow, more stable to prick withall, but slower for the
    cast. The little string is clean contrary, not so sure, therefore to be
    taken heed of, lest with long tarrying on it break your bow, more fit to
    shoot far, than apt to prick near; therefore, when you know the nature of
    both big and little, you must fit your bow according to the occasion of your
    shooting. In stringing of your bow (though this place belong rather to the
    handling than to the thing itself, yet because the thing, and the handling
    of the thing, be so joined together, I must need sometimes couple the one
    with the other) you must mark the fit length of your bow. For, if the string
    be too short, the bending will give, and at the last slip, and so put the
    bow in jeopardy. If it be long, the bending must needs be in the small of
    the string, which being sore twined, must needs snap in sunder, to the
    destruction of many good bows. Moreover, you must look that your bow be well
    nocked, for fear the sharpness of the horn sheer asunder the string. And
    that chanceth oft when in bending, the string hath but one wap to strengthen
    it withal. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(64, 0, 0);">You
        must mark also to set your string straight on, or else the one end shall
        writhe contrary to the other, and so break your bow</span>. </span>When
    the string beginneth never so little to wear, trust it not, but away with
    it; for it is an ill saved halfpenny, that costs a man a crown. Thus you see
    how many jeopardies hangeth over the silly poor bow, by reason only of the
    string. As when the string is short, when it is long, when either of the
    nocks be naught, when it hath but one wap, and when it tarrieth over long
    on."<br>
    <br>
    The line <span style="color: rgb(64, 0, 0);">"You must mark also to set
      your string straight on, or else the one end shall writhe contrary to the
      other, and so break your bow" <span style="color: black;">to me suggests
        that the string should not be allowed to go to one side of the bow tip.
        &nbsp;On my nocks the string runs diagonally along the length of the bow
        (i.e. the string sits to the side of the bow tips)<br>
        If this is the case then I do not know how.<br>
