    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">I have been trying to figure out
    a better design of tiller for my bow
    making - it seems there are several ways of doing it but each way has
    its own problem associated with it<br>
    So, here is the design I have come up with:<br>
    <br>

        <!-- If it is December display Festivus banner -->
            <div id='festivusDiv'></div>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="js/festivus.js"></script>    
        
        <!-- show banner if 'alanesq.com/banner.gif' exists -->
            <div id='bannerDiv'></div>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="js/banner.js"></script>    <!-- check if banner.gif exists and if it does insert html in to div above -->
                  
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <img style="width: 735px; height: 551px;" alt="tiller4" src="longbow/tiller/tiller4.jpg"><br>
    <br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
    <table style="text-align: left; width: 635px;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 371px; vertical-align: top;">I
            used to hang the scales from the bow but I decided this was not such
            a good
            idea because if the bow fails there is a very good chance it will
            trash
            the scales<br>
            but the problem with hanging the bow from the scales is that as you
            increase the weight on the scales they extend <small>(e.g. mine
              extend 15mm with 130lb on them) </small>, so it is difficult to
            accurately measure draw length<br>
            so I came up with the idea is hanging a metal ruler from the scales
            -
            this works great and means all measurements can be guaranteed to be
            very accurate.</td>

              src="longbow/tiller/tiller2.jpg"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    BTW
    - The scales are hung from a bolt which goes right through the wall,
    this way there is no chance of it coming away from the wall when I have
    my bow on it<br>
    You need to make sure that all mountings are very solid
    as the last thing you want is for a bow to be ruined because of tiller
    failure. &nbsp;I have seen pictures of the damage a pulley can do
    to your face if it pulls free of the wall - it is not something you
    want to happen !<br>
    <br>
    I am still working on a better way to mount the bow on the tiller -
    some kind of strong metal hook the bow will just sit on rather than
    wrapping a rope round the bow (watch this space) ?<br>
    <br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
    I think that with heavy bows a winch is&nbsp;essential&nbsp;<small>(mine
      was Â£5 from eBay)</small> but even when making light bows I think
    it is still a good idea.&nbsp; Whilst you can do it by hand, if a
    bow breaks you will be launched in the opposite direction <small>(in
      my case through my hedge)</small> and also a winch will release
    the pressure as soon as the bow gives way and so it results in much
    less of an explosion/shrapnel<br>
    A winch makes the whole process so much easier and it means you can
    stop at any point and study the bow without trying to hang on to the
    rope, it also gives a really satisfying clicking as you wind the bow up
    :-)<br>
    <br>
    <img style="width: 640px; height: 388px;" alt="tiller1" src="longbow/tiller/tiller1.jpg"><br>
    <br>
    The pulley is very solidly attached to the wall and it is a very
    solid pulley, The arm with the winch on then bolts to the pulley
    mounting (and can quickly be removed when not in use)<br>
    This arm the winch is on also gives extra support to the pulley
    mounting and pevents any risk of it being pulled from the wall<br>
    <br>
    Note
    - Use a good quality rope - I have found the cheap blue type of rope
    most people use can snap when you least expect it - this resulted in my
    being thrown through my hedge backwards, it didn't do my bow any good
    either.<br>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 195px;">A
            good feature of this setup is that when I am not using it, most of
            it
            quickly disconnects leaving the wall clear with no marking or
            anything<br>
            I use the mortar lines to help compare bow limbs so I find I do not
            need to draw any horizontal lines etc.<br>

      design</span><br>
    <br>
    I
    have now made myself a metal "hook" which the bow sits in <small>(It
      is just
      made from some thick stainless steel)</small>, this makes it much
    easier
    removing and replacing the bow when tillering and also has the
    advantage that the "ruler" can be solidly attached to
    this hook <small>(I have
      made the ruler mounting adjustable so it can be easily moved up or down
      to suit the
      bows thickness via the wing nut)</small><br>

    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Misc
      notes</span><br>
    <br>
    Some people prefer to use a couple
    of pulleys and loop the rope round them to reduce the effort needed to
    pull the bow rather than use a
    winch<br><br>
    Note - I do exclusively make warbows <small>(i.e. in the 130lb area)</small>
    so you may not need to make your tiller this strong, but even if you
    plan to make lighter bows there is no harm in doing so as it gives you
    the option.<br>
