      page details the creation of
      yet another of my strange&nbsp;projects.....</span><br>
    This
    time I had a vary vague idea that I wanted to make a clock using a very
    simple robotic arm, the idea was to have an old style analogue clock
    face
    but instead of the arms moving themselves,&nbsp;the robotic arm moves
    periodically and pushes the hands&nbsp;round. &nbsp;<br>
    So I first had a try building a robotic arm, this was a very
    interesting project in it's self as it involved a lot of maths <small>(I
      have recently been trying to teach myself some maths so this was a good
      chance to try it out)<br>

          <td style="width: 50%; text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Dec
            2012: I
            first tried using servos but whilst this looked promising, it turns
            out that the angles servos actually move to are very non
            linear&nbsp;and so I was unable to
            get any kind of usable accuracy from them.&nbsp; I then had a try to
            see
            what I could do with a couple of cheap stepper motors <small>(£5
              for 2 from eBay including control circuits)</small> building the
            most
            basic arm I could think of.<br>
            This is much better, the motors have a bit of play in them <small>(and
all
              the joints for that matter)</small>
            so there is some free play in the arm, but it is good enough to do
            something
            with and at a total cost of £5 plus a bit of wood ans some bolts, it
            is
            a good
            project in it's self and probably has lots of uses....<br>
            <br>
            I control it with an Arduino Uno <small>(see more info <a href="arduino.htm"
                target="_blank">HERE</a>) </small><br>
            To
            position the arm it just requires to be given an x and y coordinate
            <br>
            i.e. tell it
            to move to 100,150 and the arm will move so that it's tip is 100mm
            to
            the right and 150mm above the motors output shaft. &nbsp;This is
            where
            the maths came in, you can see more on how I did
            this <a href="http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,135176.0.html"
              target="_blank">HERE</a><br>
            <br>
            The
            arm is very easy to build, it is just two&nbsp;stepper motors
            mounted
            so they are facing each
            other with the output shafts opposite,&nbsp;I then turn both at the
            same rate to move
            the shoulder and one on it's own to move the elbow, very simple but
            works surprisingly well.<br>
            <br>
            The Arduino Sketch for this arm can be seen <a href="clock/robosketch.htm"
              target="_blank">HERE<br>
            </a>In
            this sketch you enter the coordinates via the serial monitor (e.g.
            100,120) and the arm moves to that position. - As I am learning,
            robotic
            is much more complicated than I ever imagined, so there is plenty
            could
            be improved on this - but it works.......<br>

    <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">So, now I have a working arm I now
      need to start thinking about what to
      do with it ???</span><br>
    My
    original plan of an analogue clock face is feasible but a friend had an
    idea which I am starting to like more;&nbsp;instead of a traditional
    clock face with hands the robot points to numbers for the minutes, then
    have
    some kind of device where it slides a pointer up and down to indicate
    hours<small> (not
      figured this out yet)</small> but the bit I really like is his idea of
    a bell which
    the arm rings to indicate the hour :-)<br>
    <br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
    Jan 2013: &nbsp;I have
    now made a slider for the indication of the hour. &nbsp;This turned out
    to be much more difficult than I expected. &nbsp;The problem was making
    something easy enough for the very weak arm to move but it needs to
    stay in place whilst vertical when the arm has moved it. &nbsp;In the
    end I used a magnet sliding along a chromed metal bar.<br>
    There is a
    lot more work to do on this, but it is now working to some extent.
    &nbsp;The other problem I have is because there is so much free play in
    the cheap stepper motors accuracy is an issue (I have added some weight
    to the end of the arm to try and help with this)<br>
    See video of the progress so far <a href="http://youtu.be/XquJrUasV0Y" target="_blank">HERE</a><br>
    <br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
    May 13: I have not done much recently on this project.&nbsp; I am stuck
    at the moment on how to indicate the hours and I am waiting for
    insparation on how to do this.<br>
    I have made a slide which the arm can move up and down but with the
    limitations on accuracy of the basic arm linkages (and code) I am
    struggling to make it reliable enough.&nbsp; I think some other system
    is required?<br>
    <br>
    I could just use a LED display or something for the hours, but I think
    the arm moving some kind of indicator would be the main point of this
    clock (if it has any point ?)<br>
    <br>
    Sep13: I think I have abandoned this project.&nbsp; I was working on it
    back in May when I had this sudden realisation that this is just
    pointless and I have not looked at it since????<br>
    I may get back to it some time but I think the real problem was that it
    was proving very difficult to come up with a way to indicate the hours
    and I just lost interest and moved on to other things.......<br>
    <br>
    I will leave this page up though as I think the robotic arm is an
    interesting/easy project in it's self so may be of interest to someone
    as a first step into robotics?<br>
