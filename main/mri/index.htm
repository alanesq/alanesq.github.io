      After becoming interested in MRI scanners (one of my many strange interests I have 
      developed for no clear reason) I volunteered to have a couple of MRI scans they are truly amazing machines  
      (see bottom of page for more info).  I had been interested in these machines for a while, so jumped at the chance 
      to stick my head in Britain's biggest scanner. The MRI scanner has to be a contender for one of the most amazing 
      inventions of all time, the way they produce an image with no moving parts and lots of clever tricks/maths is
      straight out of science fiction....

          The&nbsp;image below is from one of my scans on their 7 tesla scanner,

          How MRI&nbsp;works</span><br>
        <br>
        I found it pretty difficult to figure out the basics of how MRI scanners
        work; because it is of course a very complex subject but probably mostly
        because there is not much info out there that the lay person can
        understand. &nbsp;It is well worth doing though as it is real
        fascinating stuff.&nbsp; They involve super conducting magnets, quantum
        physics,&nbsp;near absolute zero temperatures and some mind blowing
        concepts.....what's not to like?<br>
        Of course to truly understand it all takes a super human brain, but to
        understand the basic concept of how they work can be done by anyone
        willing to find out.<br>
        - just a taster of how extraordinary they are; watch<a href="http://www.revisemri.com/tutorials/what_is_k_space/what_is_k_space_files/fullscreen.htm"
          target="_blank"> THIS</a> animation of how the image is produced
        &nbsp;(the actual result you get from an MRI scanner just looks like a
        strange splodge - this is called K-Space, each pixel in K-space relates
        to a simple sine wave, all these sine waves when added together produces
        the final image - all to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform"
          target="_blank">fourier transform</a> which is explained really well <a
          target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY">HERE</a>)<br>
        <br>
        Below are links to some good sources of info I did find - The video
        series is very good for how magnetic resonance works but I found it
        confusing when it came to the image scanning and traversing K space etc.<br>
        If there is enough interest in this page and people seem to be having
        the same problems I did understanding this, I may have a try at
        explaining it here - so let me know if this would be of interest/use at
        alanesq@disroot.org<br>
        <br>
        I found these videos to be very good - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.magritek.com/videos.html"

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interesting Fact:&nbsp;</span> They
        used to be called N.M.R.I. standing for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
        Imaging but the use of the word nuclear scared people as they don't
        understand what it actually means and so they were re named
        M.R.I..&nbsp; It has been suggested that this name change has saved
        countless lives as it no longer put patients off going for the scan.<br>
