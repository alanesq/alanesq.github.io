        Back in 2018 I happened to stumble upon the Arduino software GRBL whilst browsing the internet.  I thought it 
        seemed very interesting so installed it on an Arduino UNO, connected a couple of cheap stepper motors I had and had 
        a play;  Next thing I knew I was building myself a CNC router.  As is a common theme with my projects I did 
        not bother researching the subject first but just made a start with no real plan or idea what I was doing, 
        my only goal was to build it as cheaply as possible and only use open source software.<br>
        I created diy linear rails using skateboard bearings and whilst these worked they were difficult to set up, 
        unreliable and I later replaced them all with commercial linear rails from ebay.  I just used threaded bar 
        for the lead screws and this also worked but it resulted in the router moving pretty slowly and I later 
        replaced them with commercial lead screws as these are again not very expensive.<br>
        Building your own CNC table is nothing like as difficult as you might imagine, the physical device is actually 
        surprisingly simple, all the clever stuff is done by the software.  You basically just have to make a table 
        which has a beam across that can slide freely but be pretty rigid this moved by a worm gear.  This is then
        just repeated three times to get the x, Y, and Z movement of the router.<br>
        Every component I used was the cheapest available on eBay but despite this I have not had any issue with any 
        of them.  My CNC router is bigger and more complex than it needs to be because it has been modified etc. over 
        time.  The main thing I would do differently if starting again now is I believe using two motors (one either 
        side) for the Y axis would make the whole thing more stable and less complex to build.  I am really pleased 
        with my idea to put all the electronics in the gantry of the machine as it hides it all away very nicely, 
        also having motors with shafts extending for encoders allowed me to fit manual adjust wheels which I find a 
        very handy feature I would not like to be without..<br>
        <br> 
        Whilst I use an Arduino UNO for the controller in my CNC router I think this is pushing it to its limits and 
        using a Arduino Mega would probably be a better idea although there is now a version for ESP32 which looks
        very good (links for all software I use at bottom of page).  You can these days pick up ready made circuit 
        boards designed for the task which would probably be an easier option.<br>
        On my laptop I use UniversalGcodeSender to send the commands (gcode) to the Arduino, this may not be the best 
        option but it works reliably for me?<br>
        Creating the gcode can get as complicated as you wish, most people seem to use Fusion 360 but as I only want 
        to use truly free software and definately nothing "in the cloud" I used FreeCad which is very good but after 
        spending a lot of time learning to use it I later realised that a full CAD application is way more than I 
        tend to require for the things I make and it was just making everything far more difficult than it needed to 
        be.  So I now draw what I require in Inkscape and then use KrabzCam to produce the gcode from this, this has 
        resulted in my being able to draw the shape of what I require and have my CNC router cut it for me very 
        quickly and easily and has resulted in my CNC router being a tool I don't know how I ever lived without.<br><br>
        To give some idea of what it cost to build the Arduino cost £3, the 3 motor control boxes were £6 each, the 24v 
        power supply £12, linear bearings were around £30 for the large ones, Stepper motors around £20 each, 
        router £30.  The router bits I find I use most are 3.175mm and 1.5mm diameter and cost around £8 for 10.<br><br>
