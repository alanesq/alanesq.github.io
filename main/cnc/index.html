      In 2018, I stumbled upon the Arduino software GRBL while browsing the internet. I was intrigued and so installed it on 
      an Arduino UNO, connecting it to a couple of the cheap eBay stepper motors (ULN2003) to experiment. Before I knew it, 
      I had begun building my own CNC router. I didn't do any research beforehand, as is typical for my projects, but simply 
      started with the goal of building it as cheaply as possible using only open-source software.<br>
      I created DIY linear rails using skateboard bearings which I used for a while but they were difficult to set up and 
      unreliable. I eventually replaced them with commercial linear rails from eBay. I also used threaded bar for the lead 
      screws, but this caused the router to move too slowly, so I eventually replaced these with commercial lead screws.<br>
      Contrary to what you might imagine, building a CNC table is surprisingly simple. The physical device is straightforward, 
      while the software does most of the heavy lifting. All you need to do is create a table that has a rigid, sliding beam 
      across it, moved by a worm gear, and repeat this process three times for the X, Y, and Z movements of the router.<br>
      Although I used the cheapest components available on eBay, I haven't encountered any issues with them. My CNC router 
      has evolved over time and become bigger and more complex than really necessary, if I were to start over, I would use 
      two motors for the Y axis to make the device more stable and easier to build. I am pleased with my decision to place 
      all the electronics in the gantry, which keeps them nicely hidden away. The motors with shafts extending for encoders 
      allowed me to add manual adjustment wheels, which have proven to be a valuable feature I would not like to be without.<br>
      While I use an Arduino UNO as the controller in my CNC router, I believe an Arduino Mega or the new ESP32 version 
      would be a better choice. There are also ready-made circuit boards designed for the task that would make it easier.<br>
      On my laptop, I use UniversalGcodeSender to send commands (gcode) to the Arduino, which works reliably for me, 
      although there may be better options available. Creating the gcode can be as complex as you want it to be, and many 
      people use Fusion 360. However, since I only use free (FOSS) software, I opted for FreeCad, which is a great program 
      but overkill for my needs. I later realized that a full CAD application was not necessary, so I now draw what I need 
      in Inkscape and use KrabzCam to produce the gcode. This process has allowed me to quickly and easily draw and cut 
      shapes with my CNC router, making it an essential tool in my workshop.<br><br>  
      
      <a href="pics/demo.svg" target="_blank">THIS FILE</a> is an example of a Inkscape file I have created, I then load this 
      file in to KrabzCam and this produces the gcode files, these files I then load in to UniversalGcodeSender and this operates
      the router.  There is a link to KrabzCam at the botom of this page if you want to give it a try, it is a very
      impressive bit of software I only recently discovered.<br><br>

      To give some idea of what it cost to build the Arduino cost £3, the 3 motor control boxes were £6 each, the 24v 
      power supply £12, linear bearings were around £30 for the large ones, Stepper motors around £20 each, 
      router £30.  The router bits I find I use most are 3.175mm and 1.5mm diameter and cost around £8 for 10.<br><br>
