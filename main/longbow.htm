    This is basically a diary of my own archery experiences, but I hope there
      is lots of advice/information here which will be helpful and/or
      interesting.        It concentrates at first on my quest to get a bow with
      no animal derived parts as I try to avoid them, but I think this page will
      be of interest to everyone.<br>
    
      It all stared for me in Jun06</strong> - I found myself enrolled on a
    archery training course - I had pointed out our local club <font size="2">(</font><a
      href="http://www.bra-uk.co.uk/" target="_top"><font size="2">Beeston
        Rylands Archers</font></a><font size="2">)</font> to my girlfriend a
    week or so before as she had once mentioned that she would love to try
    archery, next thing I new we were both enrolled !!<br>
    <p>It consisted of four 2 hour lessons, I thought the first one may be
      interesting but how I would get through the other three I could not
      imagine...... It turned out that I really enjoyed it and the two hours
      lessons just flew past.<br>
      As it happens, I had always fancied the idea of trying a longbow <small>(the
bow
        which had won the battle at Agincourt etc. etc.)</small> so when it came
      to the end of the course and time to think about buying myself a bow I had
      already decided that the longbow was the only way to go <small>(the
        modern bows hold no&nbsp;interest to me but longbows are a piece of
        history etc.) <big>but as no one in the club used a traditional
          &nbsp;bow I had no idea where to start.</big></small></p>
    <p align="center"><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/english-longbow" target="_top">What
is
        a English longbow</a></p>
    <p>I suspected longbows would have animal derived parts in their make-up as
      they are a very traditional item, and I try to avoid all animal derived
      products if I can (being vegan) - No problem I thought, I will just get a
      bow made without the leather handle.....</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Why would you want a longbow with no animal derived items in its
        making</strong>?</p>
    <p>My policy is to live my life without harming any other animal <font size="2">(including
        humans)</font> unless absolutely necessary - not as easy as it sounds</p>
    <p>At first it seems there is nothing wrong with using horn as surely its
      just thrown away when an animal is slaughtered if its not used anyway, and
      the same goes for the feathers?<br>
      Well, this could be true but, if money changes hands for the horn or
      feathers then this money will be counted toward the profitability of the
      production/slaughter of these animals so by buying these I feel I would be
      a part of this just as much as if I had bought the meat. I have not yet
      managed to find out exactly where the horns used for longbows come from,
      so I am avoiding them.</p>
    <p>Whilst trying to discover more about where the horns and feathers used
      for longbows come from I found an American FAQ on bow making with this
      section in it:<br>
      <font color="#008000"><strong>"I am currently using turkey feathers to
          fletch with, after spending half a day on a commercial turkey farm
          plucking wing feathers as the birds went into the slaughter house.
          Admittedly the other workers thought I was nuts but hey, that's life
          :-) And I've now got a sack of feathers in the garage which should
          last me several years. Although some of them need to be dyed to cover
          up the bloodstains. :-( The turkeys were *not* happy with the
          situation. " <br>
        </strong></font>This I doubt is the norm, but it did prove for me that I
      was right to be careful what went into making my bow and arrows.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.trueflightfeathers.com/faq.htm" target="_top">Here</a>
      is some info. on where&nbsp;Trueflight feathers come from - they are <font
        color="#008000"><strong>"gathered at U.S. turkey processing plants"</strong></font>,
      which doesn't sound&nbsp;good to me :-(</p>
    <hr>
    <p>I contacted a few longbow makers (Bowyers) asking if they could do
      anything to help me out. I soon received a reply from <a href="http://www.bickerstaffebows.co.uk/"
        target="_top">Pip Bickerstaff </a>but I then seemed to spend more time
      trying to defend my vegan lifestyle choices than working out a solution to
      getting myself a longbow. It soon became clear he was not interested in
      making me a bow so I had to look else where. To be fair though, whilst we
      disagreed on animal rights issues, he did put a lot of effort into
      replying to my emails and he gave me a lot of info on how bows are made
      etc... (most bowyers I contacted just ignored me)</p>
    <p>One piece of news I did get from this which sounded pretty terminal was
      that the archery associations insists that all longbows have horn tips
      (nocks). I contacted the <a href="http://www.gnas.org/" target="_top">GNAS</a>
      asking for clarification on this point but again I seemed to have to
      defend my being vegan and I found out little more than "the rules must be
      followed" (whatever they are?), it was also hinted at that other longbow
      archers would not take kindly to someone having a bow which doesn't
      conform ???<br>
      NFAS The field archery association I understand is more forgiving on what
      bows are used?<br>
      <strong></strong>It was looking like there is nothing can be used in place
      of feathers on the arrows with a longbow as they would cut your hand (it
      made sense to me as the arrow rests on your hands on a longbow, anything
      other than feather would slice your hand when you release the arrow?).</p>
    <p>So at this point it looked like it was pretty hopeless. I was unable to
      find a bow maker who was willing to help me and if I did I wouldn't be
      allowed to use the bow at a club anyway.</p>
    <p><strong>UPDATE Jun07</strong> - I have just received an email from GNAS
      to say that anything can now be used to make the nocks and the wording of
      the rules will be changed to reflect this :-)</p>
    <p>Note - I did later receive a reply from another local Bowyer and they
      were more positive - <a href="http://www.kgarchery.co.uk/" target="_top">K.G.Archery</a>
      - They seemed a bit bemused by my request but they did have some
      suggestions<br>
      Among other things, they suggested that a flat bow may be worth
      considering as it is very similar to a longbow and they can be shot in
      competitions as a bare bow with modern aluminum arrows (i.e. no feathers)
      - <font size="2">I am determined to get a longbow, but this may be a last
        resort if all else fails</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I eventually emailed pretty much every bowyer I could find
        on the internet but I had very few replies.</font></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I wondered if it were possible to get some horn material without
      involving any cruelty - maybe some animals shed their horn naturally or
      maybe antlers could be used and so usable material could be collected from
      a forest floor somewhere?<br>
      It turns out that the horn used is taken from slaughtered animals and
      antlers which are shed naturally are of no use in bow making as its the
      wrong type of material. <font size="2">(I was later told they could be
        used but they are difficult to work with and far from ideal)</font><br>
      It may be possible to find an animal sanctuary or similar where a horned
      animal has died naturally but even this would be far from ideal and being
      "farm animals" it would probably be illegal due to all the regulations
      etc..?<br>
      <font size="2"><em><strong></strong></em></font></p>
    <p><big><font size="2"><big><em><strong>Update Apr07</strong></em> - Steve
            Stratton (of DIY Archery) has used goat horn which is from a species
            which naturally shed their horns so it is possible to find cruelty
            free horn to use. Also, I have discovered that Axminster Power Tools
            sell fake horn material </big></font><font size="1"><big>- See
            below for more details. Also antler can be used (it has to be soaked
            first to make it soft enough to work)<br>
          </big></font></big><br>
      Feathers on the other hand I thought more feasible as surely they could be
      collected from a nature reserve or something after they have naturally
      fallen from the birds?&nbsp;<br>
      I was informed that only 4 feathers per bird can be used for making arrows
      and they have to be in best condition, so finding enough of these seemed a
      bit unlikely (3 per arrow, 8 arrows = 24 feathers = 6 full birds).</p>
    <hr> <br>
    <p>I was pretty much ready to give in on the idea when I made contact with
      someone via eBay who makes bows<small> (very good and cheap bows by all
        accounts)</small> and he was more positive / helpful :-)</p>
    <p>He said he could supply a bow without horn <small>(self nocked)</small>
      but he was unable to offer any alternative to feathers but if I were to
      collect some he was willing to have a go at making arrows with them for
      me.<br>
      He even offered to collect feathers from local road kill pheasants for me<font
        size="2"> (I was very impressed because collecting feathers from road
        kill is not a very pleasant thing to have to do)</font>. Whilst this may
      seem against my vegan principles at first, I was unable to think of any
      logical reason why this was an ethical problem <font size="2">(as the
        animal wasn't killed for fun for profit - or even on purpose)</font> so
      I asked him to go ahead.<br>
      Maybe next time I have arrows made I will have had time to collect some
      decent fallen feathers but at the moment this seems my best/only option.</p>
    <p>There was no answer I could find to the horn problem <small>(I didn't
        expect any horned road kill cows to turn up in the near future ;-) </small>so
      in the end I decided my best option was to have a bow made which used
      something other than horn but looks as standard as possible - I thought a
      self nocked bow would draw too much attention? - If I get thrown out the
      archery club now, at least I can say I did all I could ?????</p>
    <p>I have asked him to make me a bow and some arrows....</p>
    <hr>
    <p>I have since made contact with a vegetarian archer - <a href="http://preview2.awardspace.com/kevinboone.com/traditional_archery_faq.html"
        target="_top">Kevin Boone</a><br>
      he tells me the archery associations are not as strict as I had been led
      to believe and he has seen self nocked bows being used at club events. <br>
      He also tells me that the quality of feather is not as vital as I had been
      informed, so collecting feathers from the floor<small> (even possibly
        seagull feathers from a beach)</small> he thinks would work ok. - I hope
      to give this a try at a later date<br>
      He also says its perfectly possible to shoot a modern arrow from a
      longbow, these do not use feathers at all, so I suspect it must be
      possible to make a wooden arrow without feather fletching? - but you
      wouldn't be allowed to enter any competition with these as plastic flights
      would be seen as cheating.</p>
    <p>I still think the pheasant feather option is my best plan for starters
      and I really like the idea of having a "proper" bow with the fake nocks <small>(rather
        than a self bow)</small></p>
    <hr>
    <p align="left"><strong></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Several weeks later:</strong></p>
    <p align="left">I found someone where I work who has a longbow and he
      brought it in to work to show me, its a <strong>very</strong> nice Yew
      self bow - in fact its such a nice bow that it made me realise that the
      laminated bows being sold these days are a very different thing to a
      traditional longbow - So this changed my plans quiet radically !!!</p>
    <p align="left">I was coming to realise that the chap in Norfolk was not
      going to make me a bow, as I had still not even managed to get a price for
      the bow I had requested. <br>
      I visited a local archery shop (<a href="http://www.kgarchery.co.uk/" target="_top">K.G.Archery</a>)
      just to have a look what was available etc.. - Of course by the time I got
      out the shop I had spent £300 ;-)</p>
    <p align="left">I wasn't impressed with the longbows (nothing wrong with
      them, just after seeing the self bow I had taken a bit of a dislike to the
      Victorian style ones) and they let me try one of the <a href="http://www.kgarchery.com/Tra_Kg_Cobra.htm"
        target="_top">flat bows</a> they had originally suggested would be worth
      considering. It now seemed my only option if I wanted any bow at all in
      the near future and it meant I could use modern arrows so no feather
      problems - I bought one (56lb @ 28").<br>
      It was the archery club night so I took it along to give it a try - I
      thought of it just as my temporary practice bow until I could get myself a
      decent longbow but by the end of the 3hr session I had decided I really
      like it - despite the fact it had almost destroyed my arm <font size="2">(it
        took 3 days for the swelling to start to go down - I think a better arm
        guard is my next project ;-)</font></p>
    <p align="center">------------------------------------------</p>
    <p align="left">Actually, since proof reading the above I realised that my
      quest had actually been a bit of a failure really, as I had set out to get
      myself a longbow and I still didn't have one!<br>
      So I ordered a cheap longbow from <a href="http://www.steveralphs.com" target="_top">Steve
        Ralphs</a> (£70 plus £20 postage) - Its a self bow with self nocks made
      from sycamore. <br>
      I wasn't expecting much as its just a re-enactment bow really but so far I
      have been very impressed with it - other than getting a Yew bow which
      costs big money I think this may actually be my ideal bow?<br>
      <font size="2"><em>Update Oct 2010 </em>- This bow has indeed turned out
        to be a very good bow and it is still in use to this day </font></p>
    <p align="left">I was expecting the longbow to be a much harder bow to use
      than my flat bow but it turns out the flat bow is a bit of a brute to
      shoot and so the longbow is a dream to shoot after this (I like the flat
      bow, but its not a friendly bow to be learning with, it has a lot of
      kickback and attacks your arm given the slightest chance)<br>
      <font size="2"><strong></strong></font><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
    I have matched the spine of my arrows spot on but the weights of the
    finished arrows are up to 50 grain difference (not sure how you get round
    this?) but they seem to work well :-)<br>
    <p align="left">BTW - Someone on a forum suggested that epoxy resin mixed
      with charcoal, put on the tips of the bow and polished makes a good fake
      horn so I may experiment with this one day ?</p>
    <p>I have tried searching for feathers around the local nature reserve
      without much luck so I had pretty much given up on having feather
      fletchings on my arrows and I have been using plastic ones. I recently
      received an email from a <a href="http://www.swanuk.org.uk" target="_top">swan
        sanctuary</a> I had contacted a while back and they are willing to send
      me some swan feathers they have collected.<br>
      I have now made an arrow with feather fletches - it didn't make much
      difference to the flight of the arrow (with my skill level anyway) and
      they are very delicate and a bit of a pain having to be careful not to
      damage them (also it takes a lot of feathers to pick out some decent ones)
      so I think I will stick with plastic fletches and just make myself a best
      set of arrows with feathers?<br>
      BTW - I have not had any problem with the plastic fletches hitting my

      pain and he is converting his arrows to plastic fletchings.</p>

    <p><strong>Several more weeks later:</strong></p>
    <p>I have been using my sycamore bow for a while now and its still working
      ok but I am beginning to realise that I will soon need something better,
      not least of which because I am starting to shoot at 30 yards now and its
      struggling to reach.</p>
    <p>Just as I was getting demoralised and fed up with all the negative
      attitudes I am experiencing regarding my vegan archery etc.. and my
      inability to find anyone who will help me; <br>
      I found a bowyer who not only isn't negative about my request but he is
      actually interested in my quest and very positive about the idea of making
      me an animal friendly bow <font size="2">(If only I had found him before
        it would have saved me a lot of stress and expense!)</font><br>
      He soon convinced me that unless I am willing to pay very big money for a
      Yew bow then I need a laminated bow (as any other wood on its own is not
      up to the job) and a "full compass" medieval type bow is not accurate
      enough for target archery - so I have decided to get myself a bow which
      will shoot well rather than look good and then at a later date, when I am
      a decent shot, maybe then I can consider experimenting with something more
      traditional.<br>
      So I have placed an order for a 60lb, triple laminated bow with fake horn
      nocks (hard wood) and made to look a bit medieval if possible.</p>
    <p>This life saving bowyer who I can't praise enough is: <small><font size="5"><small><strong>Pete
              Davidson of - </strong></small></font><a href="http://www.tradlongbows.co.uk"
          target="_top"><font size="5"><small><strong>www.tradlongbows.co.uk</strong></small></font></a></small><br>
      He is putting a lot of thought and effort into making my bow and not even
      charging me any extra for any of this extra stress/work.</p>
    <p>BTW - My decision to get a laminate bow was influenced in no small part
      by the fact my friends self Yew bow I had so much loved, exploded recently
      - I don't want to spend £700 on a bow which is&nbsp; likely to fail at any
      moment (spectacular as it is !)<br>
      if you have never seen a bow fail then this is your lucky day; against all
      odds I happened to catch a friends bow breaking on my high speed camera -
      see <a href="slomo.htm" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
    <p align="center">-----------------------------------------</p>
    <p><strong>I now have the bow and I couldn't be happier with it:<br>
      </strong>It was built for me very quickly, very good
      communications/feedback as it went along and the finished bow is a real
      work of art. <br>
      Anyone thinking of buying a longbow I would highly recommend TradLongbows
      - he is a great chap and makes a great bow.</p>

          Warbow - Dec06</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">I have now realised that the bow I have
        whilst its a very good modern longbow, it is just that - i.e. its a
        Victorian take on what a longbow is and bears little resemblance to a
        medieval longbow - I have always had this nagging feeling that this
        longbow just didn't seem to be the awesome weapon I have read about in
        the history books -&nbsp;It just doesn't seem to be much more than a toy
        and I cant imagine how wars could have been won with it??</font></p>

        Feb07</strong> - I have now bought a tri laminate warbow (80lbs at 32")
      from Steve Stratton - <a href="http://www.diyarchery.com/" target="_top">DIY
        Archery</a> - just got to learn how to "shoot in the bow" now !<br>
      He was very understanding about my wanting a animal free bow and he has
      made the nocks by strengthening the bows wood using hard wood. <br>
      In fact no one on the warbow forum has shown any kind of difficulty with
      my being vegan :-)</p>

    <p align="left">I have been informed that no bow over 70lbs is allowed to be
      used at my field archery club, the target club doesn't have a problem with
      it.<br>
      There seems to be a lot of resistance to warbows at archery clubs which I
      find very odd as I would have thought that anyone interested in longbows
      would ultimately want to get themselves a warbow as this is a real longbow
      isn't it ????</p>
    <p align="left">I think shooting at the marks will be where this bow will
      really be good fun to use, I intend to visit one ASAP<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Mar07</strong> - I have now shot a good few hundred
      arrows from this warbow. I was expecting it to be very difficult to use
      and pretty much a novelty item to be shot just occasionally, but I have
      found this bow to be a perfectly usable bow and I am now a total convert
      to medieval style heavy bows :-)<br>
      Anyone interested in longbows I would really recommend you give one a try
      as it instantly becomes clear that these are <strong>real</strong>
      longbows and you will never go back :-)</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Apr07</strong> - I can confirm that shooting at the
      marks is great fun :-)<br>
      I am getting on well with the bow, now trying to get accurate with it (no
      luck so far ;-) and I have just bought an even heavier bow although I
      don't expect to be able to use this full time yet (need to build my
      technique and strength a lot more yet)<br>
      This new bow is 120lbs and I have had the nocks made from some fake horn
      material supplied by <a href="http://www.axminster.co.uk/product.asp?pf_id=19609&amp;name=horn&amp;user_search=1&amp;sfile=1&amp;jump=0"
        target="_top">Axminster Power Tools</a>. Whilst DIY Archery were able to
      make my 100lb bow self nocked he was having trouble getting the wood to
      take the weight of this bow. Until I try the bow we wont know if this new
      material is up to the job but watch this space to find out ???? - it
      certainly looks the part <br>
      I had bought a 110lb bow but found much to my surprise that this bow was
      not as heavy as I had hoped so Steve kindly swapped it for a 120lb one.
      This bow is a 4 laminate one and a VERY different beast, I spent the first
      couple of days working on trying to string it !</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Update Jun07</strong> - All was looking good with
      the nocks but they suddenly failed on me :-(<br>
      It looks like it was the heat which did it <small>(it was a very hot day)</small>
      - luckily I wasn't pulling the bow when it happened so it <small>is not</small>
      damaged.<br>
      I contacted an engineering polymer company and they suggested Acetal <small>(a
        black plastic material used for making bearings etc.)</small> so I have
      made myself some replacement nocks out of this - so far so good :-)<br>
      <font size="2"><em>Update Sep10</em> - I now use this on all my bows (upto
        140lb) and it works great, it is softer than horn though so you need to
        have now tip under the string grove</font></p>
    <p align="left">BTW - I have had my bow scales calibrated and I can now say
      with confidence that my new bow has now settled down at 112lbs at 32"<br>
      I would recommend to anyone they get some decent scales and measure their
      bow as there does seem to be a lot of variation and what your bow is and
      what you think it is are unlikely to be the same in my experience.
      &nbsp;Also a bow will tend to lose some draw weight over time/usage.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Jul 07</strong> - I have now ordered myself a High
      Altitude Italian Yew warbow from Steve Stratton (DIY archery), it wont
      arrive until next April so I now have 8 months to build my strength up as
      its going to be 150lbs !<br>
      This will be the bow which is my ultimate aim to be able to use. (i.e. it
      will be what I believe to be a perfect replica of a medieval warbow)</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Aug07</strong> - I recently decided to have a try at
      making a bow myself, it went surprisingly well <small>(once I figured out
        how to cheat anyway ;-)</small> -&nbsp;Everyone should give it a try, a
      very interesting and worthwhile experience. &nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">See
          my guide on bow making <a href="bsb.htm" target="_blank">HERE</a>
          and&nbsp;info on how to make a tiller <a href="tiller.htm" target="_blank">HERE</a></span></strong></p>

        width="160"></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Nov07</strong> - I have now made myself a 120lb at
      32" one of these bows which I am now using as my main bow (cost me £16)<br>
      Its got a lot of compression fractures (chrysals) caused because I tried
      making this one much rounder in the belly (ash is better kept square) but
      its still going strong</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="longbow/120lb.jpg" height="209"
        width="369"></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Feb 08</strong> - It took some doing but I have
      finally made myself a 140lb bow - in the end I laminated some ash and oak
      and this combination worked really well :-)<br>
      BTW - I have written a guide to making longbows (to pass on what I have
      learnt so far) <a href="The-Back-Street-Bowyer.pdf"
        target="_top">HERE</a></p>
    <p align="left">I now plan to stop making bows for a while and concentrate
      on working up to being able to use this bow!</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>BTW - My High Altitude Italian yew bow arrived</strong>,
      its 165lb at 32"<br>
      Its going to be a good while before I can draw this bow (managing around
      26" at the moment) but I think it's achievable<br>
      I visited Steve Stratton's workshop recently and he showed me a 200lb one
      he has made, this really demonstrates how good this Italian yew is as its
      not a big looking bow (copy of a Mary Rose dimensions). <br>
      As far as I know, no other yew can make a self bow this heavy, its
      impressive stuff and the nearest you will get to the wood which was used
      in medieval times.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Jun08</strong> - I am now finally starting to get
      the better of my 140lb bow - I was beginning to wonder if I would ever get
      it to full draw !<br>
      We are now forming an archery society specifically for warbows (I am the
      membership secretary) so if you have an interest in warbows then please
      consider joining, we will be holding several shoots a year and there will
      be plenty of people there who are more than willing to offer help and
      advice to anyone wishing to give medieval military archery a try<br>
      see the society website <a href="http://www.englishwarbowsociety.com" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>

    <p align="left"><strong>Aug08</strong> - The pinnacle of my archery career -
      I have appeared on national T.V. ;-)<br>
      I was shown for approx 1 second on a Channel 5 documentary "The Ghosts of
      the Mary Rose" - see clip <a href="longbow/tv.avi">HERE</a></p>
    <p align="center">Time for another picture I think - this is a recent pic of
      me shooting my 140lb bow in a EWBS flight shoot<br>
      <img src="longbow/shootin135.gif" height="438" width="227"></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sep10</span> - After
      injuring my shoulder last year <small>(which has now fully recovered)</small>
      I have decided to limit myself to 130lbs from now on&nbsp;<br>
      I have made myself a new laminate bow with much thinner tips than I
      usually dare, which I am hoping will improve my distances but I have not
      had chance to try it officially yet</p>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Feb11</span> - I have been knocked off my
    cycle by a lorry recently and this has meant I was unable to do much archery
    for a while and so I have lost a surprising amount of strength in such a
    sort time !<br>
    I am now struggling with a 125lb bow, but the strength is coming back slowly<br>
    I have decided to resign from the EWBS committee due to disagreements with
    the way it is being run. &nbsp;<br>
    This along with some other things with my local club all feels like the end
    of an era and so I have decided to end my archery career and move on to
    something new (not sure what yet?).
    <p align="left">It was nearly five years ago when&nbsp;I shot my first bow,
      it has been a very interesting experience........</p>

    <p><strong>VARNISH</strong> - I used Rustins Danish Oil for coating the
      wooden shafts - it looks just like varnish after a few coats and its very
      easy to apply (I use a foam brush) but I have now changed to "quick drying
      varnish", I don't think its as good but it drys in an hour and makes it
      much quicker making an arrow and its water based so you can clean the
      brush in water..<br>
      <font size="2">BTW - I have contacted Rustins and they assured me there
        are no animal derived products in their Danish oil.</font></p>
    <p><strong>HUNTING</strong> - I am appalled that in North America (and many
      other parts of the world) they still hunt with bows (yes, there are
      actually people who's hobby is creeping around woods shooting unsuspecting
      deer&nbsp;<strong>for fun</strong>!) - fortunately we have already banned
      bow hunting in this country :-)<br>
