    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">I am posting here info on the
    cycle trailers I have made in the
    hope they will help/encourage others to have a go at making their own.
    They are very easy to make and very useful. The first trailer is designed
    to be handy for light work (general grocery shopping etc.) where
    as the second trailer is designed for much more heavy work.<br>

    <br>
    I have a couple of cycle trailers but these are not ideal for shopping
    as it can be difficult to find a place to park and if you do there is a
    good chance someone will be stolen whilst you are in the shop,
    so I decided to see if I can make a trailer which would be more suited.<br>
    <br>
    This trailer quickly detaches from the cycle and can then be wheeled into
    the shop (as a standard shopping trolley), it then clips onto the
    supermarkets shopping trolley whilst doing my shopping, at the checkout I load
    the items straight into my trailer and then wheel it to my cycle and
    clip it back on - works great :-)<br>
    <br>
    The trailer links to my
    bike via a modified quick release compressed air hose attachment, this
    allows the fitting to twist freely and the other free movement required
    by a cycle trailer hitch is simply provided by a short length of rubber
    hose (water hose as used in a car) - The wheels were purchased from
    eBay for under £15<br>
    <br>
    BTW - I have made the wheels easy to remove for storage (and easier
    carrying in
    a car boot etc.)<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    If you don't fancy making your own, it turns out there is something
    similar available commercially <a href="http://www.bikehod.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>
    or <a href="http://www.bikesandtrailers.com/bike-trailers/burley_travoy.html"
      target="_blank">HERE</a><br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      Notes:</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    With it being pretty top heavy I wouldn't try taking
    any corners at great speed with one of these, but for
    popping to the local shops it is ideal<br>
    <br>
    If I was building it again I think I would make the frame from
    something lighter
    than the wood I used and maybe more support around the handle as there
    can be a lot of stress in that area when braking. <br>
    I suspect there must be a better way to attach the tow bar to the trolley?<br>
    Having said that, I have carried a 56lb
    weight in mine (when testing it) no problem and when empty you pretty
    much wouldn't know it was there.<br>
    <br>
    The wheels I used for this project is a kids cycle wheel - lots on eBay

    </a><br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">As I was so impressed with
      this trailer I have paid out for some better wheels (they are kids
      cycle wheels from eBay for £10 each)<br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trailer 2 - Heavy Duty
      Trailer</span><br>
    <br>
    This
    trailer I made very big and strong for when I wish to move more heavy
    or large items. &nbsp;I have even used this to move a washing
    machine -
    whilst I wouldn't like to try and do this a great distance it is no
    problem towing such an item and this trailer has proved very useful on
    many occasions.<br>
    The linkage to the bike is more complex than the
    above trailer as it has to be more solid but all I use on the cycle is
    a large bolt with an eye on it and so this allows the linkage to turn
    freely in two directions, the linkage on the trailer then provides the
    free movement in the third.<br>
