air
conditioners work</font></h1>
<ul>
<li><font color="#000000">An <b>air
conditioner</b> uses a condensable working fluid--a chemical that
easily converts from a gas to a liquid and vice versa--to transfer heat
from the air inside of a home to the outside air. This process involves
three major components and at least one fan. The three major components
are a compressor, a condenser, and an evaporator. The compressor and
condenser are usually located on the outside air portion of the <b>air
conditioner</b> while the evaporator is located on the inside air
portion. The working fluid passes through the insides of these three
components in order, over and over again, so I'll start examining what
happens to the working fluid as it enters the compressor.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The working fluid
arrives at the compressor as a cool, low pressure gas. The compressor
squeezes this working fluid, packing its molecules more tightly
together so that their density and pressure increase. The squeezing
process also does work on the working fluid, increasing its energy and
therefore its temperature. The working fluid leaves the compressor as a
hot, high pressure gas and flows into the condenser. The condenser has
metal fins all around it that assist the working fluid in transferring
heat to the surrounding outdoor air. As this transfer takes place, the
closely spaced molecules of the working fluid begin to stick to one
another, releasing additional thermal energy into the surrounding air
and causing the working fluid to transform into a liquid. By the time
the working fluid leaves the condenser, its temperature has almost
dropped back down to the outdoor temperature but it is now a liquid
rather than a gas.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This high pressure
liquid then flows into the evaporator through a narrow orifice. This
orifice allows the liquid's pressure to drop so that it begins to
evaporate into a gas. As it evaporates, it extracts heat from the air
around the evaporator because that heat is needed to separate the
molecules of the working fluid. Like the condenser, the evaporator has
metal fins to assist it in exchanging thermal energy with the
surrounding air. By the time the working fluid leaves the evaporator,
it is a cool, low pressure gas. It then returns to the compressor to
begin its trip all over again.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Overall, the working
fluid releases heat into the outside air and absorbs heat from the
inside air. The direction of heat transfer, from a cooler region to a
hotter region, is the reverse of normal and requires an input of
ordered energy so that it doesn't violate the second law of
thermodynamics (the disorder of an isolated system can never decrease).
This ordered energy is used to operate the compressor and is converted
into thermal energy in the process. This additional disordered thermal
energy enters the outside air and makes up for the additional order
that's given to the indoor air as that air is cooled.</font></p>
